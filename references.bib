	abstract = {Tools for transport planning should be ﬂexible, scalable, and transparent. The stplanr package demonstrates and provides a home for such tools, with an emphasis on spatial transport data and non-motorized modes. The stplanr package facilitates common transport planning tasks including: downloading and cleaning transport datasets; creating geographic “desire lines” from origin-destination (OD) data; route assignment, locally and interfaces to routing services such as CycleStreets.net; calculation of route segment attributes such as bearing and aggregate ﬂow; and ‘travel watershed’ analysis. This paper demonstrates this functionality using reproducible examples on real transport datasets. More broadly, the experience of developing and using R functions for transport applications shows that open source software can form the basis of a reproducible transport planning workﬂow. The stplanr package, alongside other packages and open source projects, could provide a more transparent and democratically accountable alternative to the current approach, which is heavily reliant on proprietary and relatively inaccessible software.},

All of our daily activities fall along, or in close proximity to, roads, bike paths, and subway systems to name a few. Therefore, when performing spatial analysis in many cases considering network space, as opposed to Euclidean space, allows for a more precise representation of daily human action and movement patterns. For example, people generally cannot get to work by driving in a straight line directly from their home, but move along paths within networks. To this end, spaghetti (spatial graphs: networks, topology, \& inference), a sub-module embedded in the wider PySAL ecosystem, was developed to address network-centric research questions with a strong focus on spatial analysis (Gaboardi et al., 2018; Rey et al., 2015; Rey \& Anselin, 2007).},

              Geographic analysis has long supported transport plans that are appropriate to local contexts. Many incumbent ‘tools of the trade’ are proprietary and were developed to support growth in motor traffic, limiting their utility for transport planners who have been tasked with twenty-first century objectives such as enabling citizen participation, reducing pollution, and increasing levels of physical activity by getting more people walking and cycling. Geographic techniques—such as route analysis, network editing, localised impact assessment and interactive map visualisation—have great potential to support modern transport planning priorities. The aim of this paper is to explore emerging open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning, with reference to the literature and a review of open source tools that are already being used. A key finding is that a growing number of options exist, challenging the current landscape of proprietary tools. These can be classified as command-line interface, graphical user interface or web-based user interface tools and by the framework in which they were implemented, with numerous tools released as R, Python and JavaScript packages, and QGIS plugins. The review found a diverse and rapidly evolving ‘ecosystem’ tools, with 25 tools that were designed for geographic analysis to support transport planning outlined in terms of their popularity and functionality based on online documentation. They ranged in size from single-purpose tools such as the QGIS plugin AwaP to sophisticated stand-alone multi-modal traffic simulation software such as MATSim, SUMO and Veins. Building on their ability to re-use the most effective components from other open source projects, developers of open source transport planning tools can avoid ‘reinventing the wheel’ and focus on innovation, the ‘gamified’ A/B Street

              https://github.com/robinlovelace/open-gat
              , concludes that, although many of the tools reviewed are still evolving and further research is needed to understand their relative strengths and barriers to uptake, open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning already hold great potential to help generate the strategic visions of change and evidence that is needed by transport planners in the twenty-first century.},

	abstract = {Urban morphology is the area of urban studies that explores the physical form of cities in space and the way it changes in time in relation to the agents of such change (Kropf, 2017). The discipline is based on the analysis of space, traditionally mostly visual and qualitative (Dibble et al., 2015); its objects are the fundamental elements of urban form (building, plot, street) (Moudon, 1997) as well as a range of analytical constructs such as axial maps (Ariza-Villaverde, Jiménez-Hornero, \& Ravé, 2013) or proximity bands (Araldi \& Fusco, 2019). The increased availability of morphological data and computational power have led in time to more emphasis on quantitative forms of analysis, and the emergence of Urban Morphometrics (UMM) (Dibble et al., 2017): this approach describes urban form via the systematic and comprehensive measurement of its morphological characters. Since UMM analysis is addressed both in-depth and at large scale, it is grounded on the intensive use of GIS software (proprietary ArcGIS, MapInfo, open-source QGIS) either through built-in processing tools or specific plugins like Urban Network Analysis (Sevtsuk \& Mekonnen, 2012) or Place Syntax Tool (Ståhle, Marcus, \& Karlström, 2005). However, essential functions to conduct such measurements on specific urban morphometric characters or processes such as morphological tessellation, are not always available: current plugins offer only a limited number of functionalities as they are mainly application or case-specific. This paper is hereby proposing momepy, a Python toolkit which aims to overcome such limitations by enabling a systematic in-depth analysis of urban form, to comprehensively include a wide range of measurable characters, with a prospect of expanding future development due to its open-source nature and independence on proprietary software or operating systems. The development of momepy is timely, as the role of measurable characters is vital to recognize form-based patterns and establish descriptive and analytical frameworks of human settlements, in the “age of urbanization”.},

The book explains how the structure of cities evolve in ways which at first sight may appear irregular, but when understood in terms of fractals reveal a complex and diverse underlying order. The book includes numerous illustrations and 16 pages full-color plates of stunning computer graphics, along with explanations of how to construct them. The authors provide an accessible and thought-provoking introduction to fractal geometry, as well as an exciting visual understanding of the formof cities. This approach, bolstered by new insights into the complexity of social systems, provides one of the best introductions to fractal geometry available for non-mathematicians and social scientists. Fractal Cities is useful as a textbook for courses on geographic information systems, urban geography, regional science, and fractal geometry. Planners and architects will find that many aspects of fractal geometry covered in this book are relevant to their own interests. Those involved in fractals and chaos, computer graphics, and systems theory will also find important methods and examples germane to their work. Michael Batty is Director of the National Center for Geographic Information and analysis in the State University of New York at Buffalo, and has worked in planning theory and urban modeling.

In his book, Smith fervently extolled the simple yet enlightened notion that individuals are fully capable of setting and regulating prices for their own goods and services. He argued passionately in favor of free trade, yet stood up for the little guy. The Wealth of Nations provided the first--and still the most eloquent--integrated description of the workings of a market economy.The result of Smith’s efforts is a witty, highly readable work of genius filled with prescient theories that form the basis of a thriving capitalist system. This unabridged edition offers the modern reader a fresh look at a timeless and seminal work that revolutionized the way governments and individuals view the creation and dispersion of wealth--and that continues to influence our economy right up to the present day.},

The book provides operational definitions and measurement protocols of five intangible qualities of urban design, specifically: imageability, visual enclosure, human scale, transparency, and complexity. The result is a reliable field survey instrument grounded in constructs from architecture, urban design, and planning. Readers will also find illustrated, step-by-step instructions to use the instrument and a scoring sheet for easy calculation of urban design quality scores"--},

It also explores the location decisions of utility-maximizing households and profit-maximizing firms, and it shows how these decisions cause the formation of cities of different size and shape. The framework of this edition continues to be divided into six sections: -Part I explains why cities exist and what causes hem to grow or shrink -Part II examines the market forces that shape cities and the role of government in determining land-use patterns -Part III looks at the urban transportation system -Part IV uses a model of the rational criminal to explore the causes of urban crime and its spatial consequences -Part V explains the unique features of the housing market and examines the effects of government housing policies -Part VI explains the rationale for our fragmented system of local government and explores the responses of local governments to intergovernmental grants and the responses of taxpayers to local taxes.},

	abstract = {"American urban form--the spaces, places, and boundaries that define city life--has been evolving since the first settlements of colonial days. The changing patterns of houses, buildings, streets, parks, pipes and wires, wharves, railroads, highways, and airports reflect changing patterns of the social, political, and economic processes that shape the city. In this book, Sam Bass Warner and Andrew Whittemore map more than three hundred years of the American city through the evolution of urban form. They do this by offering an illustrated history of "the City"--a hypothetical city that exemplifies the American city's transformation from village to merchant seaport, industrial city, multicentered metropolis, and, finally, regional metropolis that participates in both the local and the global. The book thereby offers a yardstick against which readers can measure the history of their own cities. Warner and Whittemore have constructed their hypothetical City from the histories of Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, focusing on commonalities that make up key patterns in American urban development. In an engaging text accompanied by Whittemore's detailed, meticulous drawings, they chart the City's changing boundaries, densities, building styles, transportation infrastructures, and population patterns. Planning for the future of cities, they remind us, requires an understanding of the forces that shaped the city's past; these are the tools of urban change. The city's protean, ever-changing nature offers each generation a fresh chance to reform (and re-form) it."--book jacket.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric aerosol particles influence the climate system directly by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. Apart from black carbon aerosol, aerosols cause a negative radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere and substantially mitigate the warming caused by greenhouse gases. In the future, tightening of controls on anthropogenic aerosol and precursor vapour emissions to achieve higher air quality may weaken this beneficial effect. Natural aerosols, too, might affect future warming. Here we analyse long-term observations of concentrations and compositions of aerosol particles and their biogenic precursor vapours in continental mid- and high-latitude environments. We use measurements of particle number size distribution together with boundary layer heights derived from reanalysis data to show that the boundary layer burden of cloud condensation nuclei increases exponentially with temperature. Our results confirm a negative feedback mechanism between the continental biosphere, aerosols and climate: aerosol cooling effects are strengthened by rising biogenic organic vapour emissions in response to warming, which in turn enhance condensation on particles and their growth to the size of cloud condensation nuclei. This natural growth mechanism produces roughly 50\% of particles at the size of cloud condensation nuclei across Europe. We conclude that biosphere–atmosphere interactions are crucial for aerosol climate effects and can significantly influence the effects of anthropogenic aerosol emission controls, both on climate and air quality.},

What problems can they successfully address, and what is beyond their scope?" "In Urban Development, leading planning scholar Lewis Hopkins tackles these thorny issues as he explains the logic of plans for urban development and justifies prescriptions about when and how to make them. He explores the concepts behind plans, some that are widely accepted but seldom examined and others that modify conventional wisdom about the use and usefulness of plans.". "Urban Development will give all those involved with planning human settlements a more thorough understanding of why and how plans are made, enabling them to make better choices about using and making plans. It is an important contribution that will be essential for students and faculty in planning theory, land use planning, and planning project courses."--BOOK JACKET.},

	shorttitle = {The {Transit} {Metropolis}},
	abstract = {Around the world, mass transit is struggling to compete with the private automobile, and in many places, its market share is rapidly eroding. Yet a number of metropolitan areas have in recent decades managed to mount cost-effective and resource-conserving transit services that provide respectable alternatives to car travel. What sets these places apart?In this book, noted transportation expert Robert Cervero provides an on-the-ground look at more than a dozen mass transit success stories, introducing the concept of the "transit metropolis"—a region where a workable fit exists between transit services and urban form. The author has spent more than three years studying cities around the world, and he makes a compelling case that metropolitan areas of any size and with any growth pattern—from highly compact to widely dispersed—can develop successful mass transit systems.Following an introductory chapter that frames his argument and outlines the main issues, Cervero describes and examines five different types of transit metropolises, with twelve in-depth case studies of cities that represent each type. He considers the key lessons of the case studies and debunks widely held myths about transit and the city. In addition, he reviews the efforts underway in five North American cities to mount transit programs and discusses the factors working for and against their success. Cities profiled include Stockholm; Singapore; Tokyo; Ottawa; Zurich; Melbourne; Mexico City; Curitiba, Brazil; Portland, Oregon; and Vancouver, British Columbia.The Transit Metropolis provides practical lessons on how North American cities can manage sprawl and haphazard highway development by creating successful mass transit systems. While many books discuss the need for a sustainable transportation system, few are able to present examples of successful systems and provide the methods and tools needed to create such a system. This book is a unique and invaluable resource for transportation planners and professionals, urban planners and designers, policymakers and students of planning and urban design.},

From the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation to the coastlines of continents, courses of rivers, clouds in the sky, branches of plants and veins in their leaves, blood vessels in the lung, and the shape of seashells and snowflakes, these fractal or self-similar patterns abound. The self-similarity of most of these patterns is defined only in a statistical sense: while the general 'roughness' is about the same at different scales, you can't extract a segment, blow it up, and find a larger scale segment which it matches precisely. However, some of the most pleasing patterns in geometric art exhibit exact or almost exact self-similarity. These are patterns which are composed of smaller copies of themselves ad infinitum, or at least until some limit where the similarity breaks down due to the granularity of the underlying material.},

All of us can remember a moment as a child when time became a personal reality, when we realized what a "year" was, or asked ourselves when "now" happened. Common sense says time moves forward, never backward, from cradle to grave. Nevertheless, Einstein said that time is an illusion. Nature's laws, as he and Newton defined them, describe a timeless, deterministic universe within which we can make predictions with complete certainty. In effect, these great physicists contended that time is reversible and thus meaningless.},

This study examines LEED-ND’s criteria for Neighborhood Pattern and Design, starting from the hypothesis that these standards fall short of capturing the livability of a place as perceived by its residents. Noe Street in the Duboce Triangle neighborhood of San Francisco serves as the study site. Field measurements show that Noe Street is ineligible for LEED-ND certification. Survey results show that a majority of residents find it highly livable, nonetheless. When asked to consider life on their street, residents put different emphasis on what makes a neighborhood livable than the LEED-ND standards.},

We focus on the tendency to discuss the planning profession in recovery metaphors – a perspective that has been emphasized in establishing how the profession's past and future relevance may be asserted. In the recent past the planning profession has sought to recover its standing and policy relevance through its contributions to real estate development. In doing so, the profession has gravitated toward design and determinism in order to satisfy pluralist demands within the loosely regulated political economy of neoliberal urban growth. But while design determinism offered numerous practical advantages to the planning profession for the short term, it also served to preclude the profession from engaging with social justice, the social construction of place, and civil society.},

Already more than half the world's population lives in urban areas, and by 2030 McKinsey projects that in China alone 350 million people will move to cities -- that's more than the current U.S. population. Such aggressive growth projections beg the question: How will cities change to accommodate the expected influx?
One approach to understanding and planning for the growing cities of the future is to harness information and communications technologies. These could help make cities safer, healthier and more economically prosperous, all of which boost a city's ability to serve a growing population.
"Can we predict how the pace and livability of cities will change as certain parameters change?" asked Intel engineer and innovation strategist Herman D'Hooge.},

Wolfram uses his approach to tackle a remarkable array of fundamental problems in science: from the origin of the Second Law of thermodynamics, to the development of complexity in biology, the computational limitations of mathematics, the possibility of a truly fundamental theory of physics, and the interplay between free will and determinism. Written with exceptional clarity, and illustrated by more than a thousand original pictures, this seminal book allows scientists and non-scientists alike to participate in what promises to be a major intellectual revolution.},

	abstract = {Most new rail transit lines in the United States and around the world are either light rail, including lines that sometimes run in or cross city streets, or heavy rail, which are built in exclusive rights of way, usually elevated or in subways. Heavy rail costs far more to build than light rail, but the capacity of light rail to move people is far lower than heavy rail. In fact, the terms light and heavy refer to people-moving capacities, not the actual weight of the equipment.Recently, a number of cities in the United States and elsewhere have built or are building a hybrid form of rail transit that can best be described as the worst of both, combining the cost-disadvantages of heavy rail with the capacity limits of light rail. Seattle is building a three-mile subway that costs nearly six times as much per mile as the average light-rail line. Honolulu is building a 20-mile elevated rail line that costs well over twice as much as the average light rail. Yet those lines will be limited to little (or no) more than light-rail capacities.The willingness of many rail advocates to support highcost, low-capacity rail lines calls into question the entire rail agenda. Supporters of low-capacity lines are not truly interested in transportation; supporters of high-cost lines are not truly interested in urban efficiencies. If they are not willing to draw the line against such projects, then there is little reason to believe their claims about the benefits of other rail projects.},

	abstract = {In The New Science of Cities, Michael Batty suggests that to understand cities we must view them not simply as places in space but as systems of networks and flows. To understand space, he argues, we must understand flows, and to understand flows, we must understand networks -- the relations between objects that comprise the system of the city. Drawing on the complexity sciences, social physics, urban economics, transportation theory, regional science, and urban geography, and building on his own previous work, Batty introduces theories and methods that reveal the deep structure of how cities function.Batty presents the foundations of a new science of cities, defining flows and their networks and introducing tools that can be applied to understanding different aspects of city structure. He examines the size of cities, their internal order, the transport routes that define them, and the locations that fix these networks. He introduces methods of simulation that range from simple stochastic models to bottom-up evolutionary models to aggregate land-use transportation models. Then, using largely the same tools, he presents design and decision-making models that predict interactions and flows in future cities. These networks emphasize a notion with relevance for future research and planning: that design of cities is collective action.},

In this reappraisal of America’s racial and economic inequalities, Thomas Sugrue asks why Detroit and other industrial cities have become the sites of persistent racialized poverty. He challenges the conventional wisdom that urban decline is the product of the social programs and racial fissures of the 1960s. Weaving together the history of workplaces, unions, civil rights groups, political organizations, and real estate agencies, Sugrue finds the roots of today’s urban poverty in a hidden history of racial violence, discrimination, and deindustrialization that reshaped the American urban landscape after World War II.This Princeton Classics edition includes a new preface by Sugrue, discussing the lasting impact of the postwar transformation on urban America and the chronic issues leading to Detroit’s bankruptcy.},

The mainstream approach which stresses the bid-rent formulations and the access/space trade-off seems to be at variance with the current reality of dispersal of both industry and housing in modern cities. In this paper, it is proposed that the focus on the city centre(s) and distance(s) from it (or them) should be shifted to two other categories of parameter: housing status and dwelling quality. A model of interaction between these parameters can be used not only to describe but also to predict various types of residential development in different urban contexts. The components of a new theory of residential location are proposed.},

	abstract = {Whether talking about steering a wheelbarrow over rugged terrain or plotting the course of international relations, human performance systems involve change. Sometimes changes are subtle or evolutionary, sometimes they are catastrophic or revolutionary, and sometimes the changes are from periods of relative calm to periods of vibrant oscillations to periods of chaos. As a general rule, more complex systems are likely to produce more complex forms of change.   Although social scientists have long acknowledged that change occurs and have considered ways to effect desirable change, the dynamical processes of change have been poorly understood in the past. This volume combines recent advances in mathematics and experimental design with the best available social science theories to produce a new, integrated, and compact theory of work, organizations, and social evolution. The domains of application extend from human decision-making processes to personnel selection and work motivation, work performance under conditions of stress, accident and health risk analysis, the development of social institutions and economic systems, creativity and innovation, organizational development and group dynamics, and political revolutions and war.   Relative to other literature on nonlinear dynamical systems theory (NDS), this book is unique in that it integrates new developments in NDS with substantive psychological theory. It builds on many recent developments in organizational theory to show that nonlinear dynamics were often implicit in those works all along. The result is an entirely new way of viewing social events, understanding change processes, and asking questions about social systems. This book also contains much new empirical work and explains the newly developed methods for testing these new hypotheses.},

	shorttitle = {Thinking {Barcelona}},
	abstract = {Thinking Barcelona studies the ideological work that redefined Barcelona during the 1980s and adapted the city to a new economy of tourism, culture, and services. The 1992 Olympic Games offered to the municipal government a double opportunity to establish an internal consensus and launch Barcelona as a happy combination of European cosmopolitanism and Mediterranean rootedness. The staging of this municipal “euphoric postpolitics,” which entailed an extensive process of urban renewal, connects with the similarly exultant contexts of a reviving Catalan nation, post-transitional Spain, and post-Cold War globalization. The transformation of Barcelona, in turn, contributed to define the ideologies of globalization, as the 1992 Games were among the first global mega-events that celebrated the neoliberal “end of history.” Three types of materials are examined: political speeches and scripts of the Olympic ceremonies, with special focus on Xavier Rubert de Ventós’s screenplay for the reception of the flame in Empúries; the urban renewal of Barcelona directed by architect Oriol Bohigas; and fictional narratives by Quim Monzó, Francisco Casavella, Eduardo Mendoza, and Sergi Pàmies. This juxtaposition of heterogeneous materials pursues some type of postdisciplinary decoding linked to a strictly Marxist premise: the premise that correlations between different superstructural elements shed light on the economic instance. In this study, Barcelona emerges as a singular conjuncture overdetermined by global capitalism, but is also a space to reflect on three main problematics of postmodern globalization: the spectralization of the social in a fully commodified world; the contradiction between cosmopolitanism and the state; and the vanishing essence of the city.},

This special class of LUCC models combines a cellular landscape model with agent-based representations of decision making, integrating the two components through specification of interdependencies and feedbacks between agents and their environment. The authors review alternative LUCC modeling techniques and discuss the ways in which MAS/LUCC models may overcome some important limitations of existing techniques. We briefly review ongoing MAS/LUCC modeling efforts in four research areas. We discuss the potential strengths of MAS/LUCC models and suggest that these strengths guide researchers in assessing the appropriate choice of model for their particular research question. We find that MAS/LUCC models are particularly well suited for representing complex spatial interactions under heterogeneous conditions and for modeling decentralized, autonomous decision making. We discuss a range of possible roles for MAS/LUCC models, from abstract models designed to derive stylized hypotheses to empirically detailed simulation models appropriate for scenario and policy analysis. We also discuss the challenge of validation and verification for MAS/LUCC models. Finally, we outline important challenges and open research questions in this new field. We conclude that, while significant challenges exist, these models offer a promising new tool for researchers whose goal is to create fine-scale models of LUCC phenomena that focus on human-environment interactions.},

A simple model of process innovation is proposed, where firms learn about their ideal production process by making prototypes. We build around this a dynamic general-equilibrium model, and derive conditions under which diversified and specialized cities coexist. New products are developed in diversified cities, trying processes borrowed from different activities. On finding their ideal process, firms switch to mass production and relocate to specialized cities where production costs are lower. We find strong evidence of this pattern in establishment relocations across French employment areas 1993-96.},

A qualitative analysis of ethnographic data based on fieldwork among evicted tenants and their landlords reveals multiple mechanisms propelling this discrepancy. In poor black neighborhoods, eviction is to women what incarceration is to men: a typical but severely consequential occurrence contributing to the reproduction of urban poverty.},

When San Francisco was on the edge of the Western frontier, it was divided into three parts - the military Presidio, a small village called Yerba Buena near the bay shore and a few houses around the Spanish Mission Dolores in what is now the Mission District.  [...] when the cable car was invented, in 1873, Nob Hill became accessible and crowded with fabulous Victorian mansions.  Transit impacts The city came back in a huge way, mostly along the lines of the brand-new Municipal Railway, which started in 1912 with a electric streetcar line out Geary Street to the Richmond District.  Not only are these rail lines the key elements of what is now the Muni Metro subway, but the rails run down the main streets of neighborhoods like the Parkside, the Inner Sunset, the Ingleside and the Outer Sunset, making them small towns in a city.  A controversial redevelopment project in the late '50s led to big changes in the Western Addition as black residents were moved to the Bayview and Hunters Point areas.  Real estate agents started calling part of the Western Addition "Baja Pacific Heights."},

Both empirical observations and theoretical approaches are critically reviewed, with particular emphasis placed on derivations of classical models and results, along with analysis of their limits and validity. Key aspects of cities are thoroughly analyzed, including mobility patterns, the impact of multimodality, the coupling between different transportation modes, the evolution of infrastructure networks, spatial and social organisation, and interactions between cities. Drawing upon knowledge and methods from areas of mathematics, physics, economics and geography, the resulting quantitative description of cities will be of interest to all those studying and researching how to model these complex systems.},

Six key terms are explored: nonlinearity, feedbacks, thresholds, hierarchies, emergence and self-organization, and dozens of related principles are discussed, with a focus on uncertainty, risk, vulnerability, learning, strategy, resilience, collapse and sustainability. The book surveys the role of these complexity principles in the natural sciences, social theory, transdisciplinary discourse, philosophy, and ethics, and shows how this complexity framework is a valuable lens for approaching the spectre of climate change and life in the Anthropocene.},

Andrew Scholtz takes this notion of "discordant harmony" and argues for it as an aesthetic principle where classical Athenian literature addresses politics in the idiom of sexual desire. His approach is an untried one for this kind of topic. Drawing on theorists of the sociality of language, Scholtz shows how eros, consuming, destabilizing desire, became a vehicle for exploring and exploiting dissonance within the songs Athenians sang about themselves. Thus he shows how societal tension and instability could register as an ideologically charged polyphony in works like the Periclean Funeral Oration, Aristophanes' Knights, and Xenophon's Symposium.},

	abstract = {Street trees provide a wide range of benefits for cities. Street tree cover (STC) is explained by urban form, social stratification and lifestyle theories that operate at multiple scales. In this paper we examine how the urban form (street characteristics), social stratification and lifestyle (socio-demographics) account for variations of STC in Montréal. Tree cover was identified from Quickbird images and then overlaid on street segments to compute the STC. Each street segment was nested in a census tract. We used 2-level models with mixed effects and interactions (between street attributes and socio-demographic variables) while introducing a spatial term. Political, socio-economic or other explanatory factors operating at the tract level can potentially explain 17.6\% of the variation of STC. Overall, the street characteristics explained more variation in STC than the socio-demographic context. Lifestyle is less important than social stratification. Street length is positively associated with STC; street width and the percentage of duplexes and triplexes are negatively associated with STC, while construction age has a u-shaped effect on STC. Interactions show that STC is higher in expensive and highly-educated areas that have residential streets or streets with large setback (sidewalk). Areas predominantly comprised of low-income households could have higher or lower STC depending on the number of buildings and the percentage of duplexes and triplexes. Streetscape and socio-demographic contexts intertwine to create complex patterns of STC. Greening programs should be designed carefully according to local contexts since certain types of greening can lead to gentrification and displacement of low-income households.},

How should one cope with complexity and uncertainty in mega infrastructure projects? While rational theories tend to eliminate or reduce these unruly conditions, the authors of this article are in search of a different approach to deal with the characteristics of complexity and uncertainty proactively. Three theoretical reflections are introduced to explore possible solutions: (1) the change of institutions to address the problem of excessively simple structures for making decisions on complex projects; (2) the shaping of a learning environment in order to deal with uncertainty and emergent properties; and (3) balancing the generation and the reduction of a variety of policy options in order to select a limited number of feasible options and to bridge the strategic exploration and the operational processes of decision making. Informed by this conceptual thought, concrete pathways are developed and discussed by means of a case study of the construction of a high-speed railway line in the Netherlands.


Résumé

Comment doit-on gérer complexité et incertitude dans le cadre de mégaprojets d'infrastructure? Tandis que les théories rationnelles ont tendance àéliminer ou à minorer ces circonstances incontrôlées, cet article recherche une approche différente pour aborder les caractéristiques de la complexité et de l'incertitude de manière proactive. Trois axes de réflexion théorique sont présentés: la transformation des institutions, pour résoudre le problème des structures extrêmement simples confrontées à des décisions sur des projets complexes; la configuration d'un environnement d'apprentissage, pour faire face à l'incertitude et aux nouveaux éléments; l'équilibrage entre génération et réduction des diverses possibilités d'action publique, afin de sélectionner un nombre restreint d'options réalisables et d'harmoniser recherche de stratégies et processus décisionnels opérationnels. À partir de cette réflexion conceptuelle, des voies concrètes sont développées et analysées à travers une étude de cas sur la construction d'une ligne ferroviaire à grande vitesse aux Pays-Bas.},

	abstract = {Tactical urbanism initiatives have been interpreted as an alternative and a challenge to formal spatial planning tools to the need for a more responsive planning system. Short-term implementation, scarce resources and citizens’ involvement are said to be the key characteristics of this emerging movement in urbanism. In tactical urbanism, everything seems focussed on one thing: action. This paper analyses tactical urbanism initiatives in the United States considering three main aspects: the process, its interaction with planning institutions and the respective urban design outcomes. For this, the relation between tactical urbanism and complexity theory (in which self-organisation and evolution play an important role) is addressed. Findings suggest some contributions that tactical urbanism can make to urban design and spatial planning, in evolutionary terms and possible role for tactical urbanism in alternative to traditional division between plan making and plan implementation.},

If people agree on what they want and how to achieve it, then certainty prevails and planning is rational application of knowledge. If they agree on what they want but do not know how to achieve it, then planning becomes a learning process; if they do not agree on what they want but do know how to achieve alternatives, then planning becomes a bargaining process; if they agree on neither means nor ends, then planning becomes part of the search for order in chaos. Each prototype situation suggests a particular range of planning styles. Planners should tailor their styles to problem conditions.

The argument centers on the definition of four fundamental types of problem, or namely: simple problems, compound problems, complex problems, and metaproblems. Each of these problem-types is held to entail a corresponding kind of strategy. From this, it is concluded that planners face a persistent dilemma in trying to choose between a broad definition of their problem and an exact strategy for solving it. The closer they come to one objective, the further they get from the other.},

Since the quality of OSM data can vary strongly, different aspects have been investigated in several scientific studies. In most cases the data is compared with commercial or administrative datasets which, however, are not always accessible due to the lack of availability, contradictory licensing restrictions or high procurement costs. In this investigation a framework containing more than 25 methods and indicators is presented, allowing OSM quality assessments based solely on the data's history. Without the usage of a reference data set, approximate statements on OSM data quality are possible. For this purpose existing methods are taken up, developed further, and integrated into an extensible open source framework. This enables arbitrarily repeatable intrinsic OSM quality analyses for any part of the world.},

The OpenStreetMap project is currently the most significant example of a system based on VGI. It aims at producing free vector geographic databases using contributions from Internet users. Spatial data quality becomes a key consideration in this context of freely downloadable geographic databases. This article studies the quality of French OpenStreetMap data. It extends the work of Haklay to France, provides a larger set of spatial data quality element assessments (i.e. geometric, attribute, semantic and temporal accuracy, logical consistency, completeness, lineage, and usage), and uses different methods of quality control. The outcome of the study raises questions such as the heterogeneity of processes, scales of production, and the compliance to standardized and accepted specifications. In order to improve data quality, a balance has to be struck between the contributors' freedom and their respect of specifications. The development of appropriate solutions to provide this balance is an important research issue in the domain of user-generated content.},

The question of whether the OSM road network should be updated through periodic data imports from public domain data, or whether the currency of OSM data should rather rely on more traditional data collection efforts by active contributors, has led to perpetual debates within the OSM community. A US Census TIGER/Line 2005 import into OSM was accomplished in early 2008, which generated a road network foundation for the active community members in the US. In this study we perform a longitudinal analysis of road data for the US by comparing the development of OSM and TIGER/Line data since the initial TIGER/Line import. The analysis is performed for the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, and 70 Urbanized Areas. In almost all tested states and Urbanized Areas, OSM misses roads for motorized traffic when compared with TIGER/Line street data, while significant contributions could be observed in pedestrian related network data in OSM compared with corresponding TIGER/Line data. We conclude that the quality of OSM road data could be improved through new OSM editor tools allowing contributors to trace current TIGER/Line data.},

Worldwide, several hundred thousand people are currently contributing information to the “free” geodatabase. However, the data contributions show a geographically heterogeneous pattern around the globe. Germany counts as one of the most active countries in OSM; thus, the German street network has undergone an extensive development in recent years. The question that remains is this: How does the street network perform in a relative comparison with a commercial dataset? By means of a variety of studies, we show that the difference between the OSM street network for car navigation in Germany and a comparable proprietary dataset was only 9\% in June 2011. The results of our analysis regarding the entire street network showed that OSM even exceeds the information provided by the proprietary dataset by 27\%. Further analyses show on what scale errors can be reckoned with in the topology of the street network, and the completeness of turn restrictions and street name information. In addition to the analyses conducted over the past few years, projections have additionally been made about the point in time by which the OSM dataset for Germany can be considered “complete” in relative comparison to a commercial dataset.},

	abstract = {How did the American people come to develop a moral association with this land, such that their very experience of nationhood was rooted in, and their republican virtues depended upon, that land? And what is happening now as the exclusivity of that moral linkage between people and land becomes ever more attenuated? In Place and Belonging in America, David Jacobson addresses the evolving relationship between geography and citizenship in the United States since the nation's origins.Americans have commonly assumed that only a people rooted in a bounded territory could safeguard republican virtues. But, as Jacobson argues, in the contemporary world of transnational identities, multiple loyalties, and permeable borders, the notion of a singular territorial identity has lost its resonance. The United States has come to represent a diverse quilt of cultures with varying ties to the land. These developments have transformed the character of American politics to one in which the courts take a much larger role in mediating civic life. An expanding web of legal rights enables individuals and groups to pursue their own cultural and social ends, in contrast to the civic republican practice of an active citizenry legislating its collective life. In the first part of his sweeping study, Jacobson considers the origins of the uniquely American sense of place, exploring such components as the Puritans and their religious vision of the New World; the early Republic and agrarian virtue as extolled in the writings of Thomas Jefferson; the nationalization of place during the Civil War; and the creation of post-Civil War monuments and, later, the national park system. The second part of Place and Belonging in America concerns the contemporary United States and its more complex interactions between space and citizenship. Here Jacobson looks at the multicultural landscape as represented by the 1991 act of Congress that changed the name of the Custer Battlefield National Monument to Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument and the subsequent construction of a memorial honoring the Indian participants in the battle; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. He also reflects upon changing patterns of immigration and settlement. At once far-reaching and detailed, Place and Belonging in America offers a though-provoking new perspective on the myriad, often spiritual connections between territoriality, national identity, and civic culture.},

Here we report the results of a detailed study of the variations in trends and lengths of 1554 named streets and 6004 street segments, forming a part of the evolving street network of the city of Dundee in East Scotland. Based on changes in the scaling exponents (ranging from 0.24 to 3.89), the streets can be divided into 21 populations. For comparison, we analysed 221 active crustal fractures in Iceland that (a) are of similar lengths as the streets of Dundee; (b) are composed of segments; and (c) form evolving networks. The streets and fractures follow power-law size distributions (validated through various statistical tests) that can be partly explained in terms of the energies needed for their formation. The entropies of the 21 street populations and 9 fracture populations show strong linear correlations with (1) the scaling exponents (R2 = 0.845–0.947 for streets, R2 = 0.859 for fractures) and with (2) the length ranges, that is, the differences between the longest and shortest streets/fractures, (R2 = 0.845–0.906 for streets, R2 = 0.927 for fractures).},

This ‘Manifesto’ argues that, born in a form of cultural studies, topology offers 21st-century researchers a model for mapping the dynamics of time as well as space, allowing the rigorous description of events, situations, changing cultural formations and social spatializations. Law and Mol’s network spaces, Serre’s folded time, Massey’s ‘power geometries’, Lefebvre’s ‘production of space’ and ‘rhythmanalysis’ can be developed through a cultural topological sensitivity that allows time to be understood as not only progressive but cyclical, relationships and the ‘reach’ of power can be understood through ‘knots’, and a topology of experience to model the ‘plushness of the Real’ via extra- and over-dimensioned time-spaces that capture nuance while drawing on systematic conceptual resources.},

However, it remains somehow mysterious and elusive, and therefore hard to grasp. This paper develops a complex network perspective on the wholeness to better understand the nature of order or beauty for sustainable design. I bring together a set of complexity-science subjects such as complex networks, fractal geometry, and in particular underlying scaling hierarchy derived by head/tail breaks — a classification scheme and a visualization tool for data with a heavy-tailed distribution, in order to make Alexander’s profound thoughts more accessible to design practitioners and complexityscience researchers. Through several case studies (some of which Alexander studied), I demonstrate that the complex-network perspective helps reduce the mystery of wholeness and brings new insights to Alexander’s thoughts on the concept of wholeness or objective beauty that exists in fine and deep structure. The complex-network perspective enables us to see things in their wholeness, and to better understand how the kind of structural beauty emerges from local actions guided by the 15 fundamental properties, and in particular by differentiation and adaptation processes. The wholeness goes beyond current complex network theory towards design or creation of living structures.},

	abstract = {Recent debates in urban planning have centered on whether the cul-de-sac street form should be eliminated from the United States’ topography. Critics argue that these closed-off streets force residents into their automobiles, reduce communal interaction, are difficult for emergency vehicles to traverse, and are not environmentally friendly. Developers, realtors, and homebuyers, on the other hand, clamor for these streets, which are private, quiet, and safe for raising children. Lacking from debates over the future of the cul-de-sac are systematic analyses assessing the social consequences of living on these streets. This study utilized a quasi-experimental design to assess differences in residential social cohesion for residents of “bulb” cul-de-sacs, “dead-end” cul-de-sacs, and through streets. My data reveal that bulb residents experience the highest levels of attitudinal and behavioral cohesion, followed by dead-ends, then through streets. With planning debates about the future of the cul-de-sac currently taking place across the country, this study provides timely insight into the relationship between street design and neighborly bonds.

However, its relationships with landscape complexity as an indicator of visual aesthetic quality have not been yet extensively discussed. The purpose of this paper is to review different dimensions of environmental heterogeneity and to explore their potential for bridging visual quality with provision of other ecosystem services and resilience in landscape design, management and planning. This synthesis reveals the substantial overlap between spatial and temporal indicators of heterogeneity from ecological literature and the indicators of visual complexity, diversity and variety from the studies of subjective preferences and objective scenic beauty criteria. The potential of heterogeneity is also reviewed in the context of the relationship between visual quality and ecological resilience to perturbations, an increasingly important objective in the face of the global environmental change. The limitations of heterogeneity as a design and management goal are also discussed, including links between heterogeneity and disturbance, undesirable outcomes of excessive landscape complexity and present lack of criteria for its optimal levels. The synthesis concludes by identifying the key strategies and research needs to facilitate the application of this concept towards multi-functional landscapes supporting versatile ecosystem services together with scenic priorities.},

This paper examines the similarities and differences in urban form and growth that have occurred across 25 mid-sized cities from different geographical settings and levels of economic development. The results reveal four city types: lowgrowth cities with modest rates of inﬁlling; high-growth cities with rapid, fragmented development; expansive-growth cities with extensive dispersion at low population densities; and frantic-growth cities with extraordinary land conversion rates at high population densities. Although all 25 cities are expanding, the results suggest that cities outside the US do not exhibit the dispersed spatial forms characteristic of American urban sprawl.},

According to the standard account, artists facilitate gentrification and ultimately engender the displacement of lower income households, but more recent research complicates the accepted narrative. This article seeks to untangle the relationship between the arts, gentrification and displacement through a statistical study of neighbourhood-level arts industry activity within large US regions. The findings indicate that the standard arts-led gentrification narrative is too generalised or simply no longer applicable to contemporary arts-gentrification processes. Rather, the arts have multiple, even conflicting relationships with gentrification and displacement that depend on context and type of art. These results have important implications for how we study the role of the arts in neighbourhood change and for how governments approach the arts and creative industries in urban policy.},

The chapter reviews research on real estate brokers as intermediaries as well, focusing on the role of brokers in the matching and bargaining process, the nature of competition and entry in the brokerage industry, and the incentive issues that are present. The chapter also considers the inefficiencies that pervade the brokerage industry and the related policy debates. These are important issues both because of the inherent importance of housing and brokerage and because of the importance of housing to macroeconomic dynamics.},

We hypothesize that households whose members disagree with each other have a larger search spaces than those whose members agree. Furthermore, the supply in the housing market and the use of different information channels may inﬂuence the search space differently for agreeing versus disagreeing households. We collected data from face-to-face interviews with 82 households (couples with or without children) who purchased a home in the New York City area between 2004 and 2009. The results support our hypotheses, suggesting that intra-household dynamics plays an important role in housing search.},

If the number of data is large, a trend may be statistically significant even if data are scattered far from the trend line. This study introduces and tests a quality criterion for time trends referred to as statistical meaningfulness, which is a stricter quality criterion for trends than high statistical significance. The time series is divided into intervals and interval mean values are calculated. Thereafter, r2 and p values are calculated from regressions concerning time and interval mean values. If r2\$0.65 at p\#0.05 in any of these regressions, then the trend is regarded as statistically meaningful. Out of ten investigated time series from different scientific disciplines, five displayed statistically meaningful trends. A Microsoft Excel application (add-in) was developed which can perform statistical meaningfulness tests and which may increase the operationality of the test. The presented method for distinguishing statistically meaningful trends should be reasonably uncomplicated for researchers with basic statistics skills and may thus be useful for determining which trends are worth analysing further, for instance with respect to causal factors. The method can also be used for determining which segments of a time trend may be particularly worthwhile to focus on.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite substantial evidence for neighborhood characteristics correlating with walking, so far there has been limited attention to possible practical implications for neighborhood design. This study investigates to what extent design guidelines are likely to stimulate walking.
Methods: Four of the New Urbanism Smart Scorecard criteria and two other measures were tested for their inﬂuence on walking. Data were obtained from the 1995 National Personal Transportation Survey, U.S. Census 2000, and InfoUSA. Propensity-score methodology was used to control for potential confounders.
Results: Higher levels of business diversity and higher percentages of four-way intersections were associated with more walking. For example, the odds ratio (OR) for walking in a neighborhood with four business types present compared to three business types was 1.24 (conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.07–1.44) and neighborhoods with 50\%–74\% four-way intersections had an OR for walking of 1.4 (CI 1.09 –1.78) relative to those with 25\%– 49\% four-way intersections. The effects of housing density on walking are mixed. Higher parking pressure and older median housing age did not signiﬁcantly affect walking after covariate adjustment. Block length did not appear to be associated with walking.
Conclusions: When considering the New Urbanism Smart Scorecard from the perspective walking,},

This is especially the case in the Mediterranean context, in which her principles for urban vitality would very well correspond to the traditional attributes of these urban settlements, even though their inherent vital nature has been progressively challenged under the paradigm of modernity. In order to contribute with the eﬀorts conducted in the past few years aimed at empirically testing Jacobs’ ideas, we consider of special interest to question the nature of these new urban conﬁgurations by analyzing Barcelona (Spain) through Jacobs’s eyes. An analysis of urban vitality throughout a systemized approach has allowed a detailed spatial interpretation of a conurbation that combines both the attributes of traditional Mediterranean cities and the conﬂicts that modernity brought with it. The approach that Jacobs provided has proven useful to highlight that this urban area is far from homogeneous, and therefore is also presented as a useful framework for other researchers and urban practitioners to study urban vitality in diﬀerent geographic contexts, especially in those areas where the logics of modern city building may still persevere.},

	abstract = {Purpose.This study evaluates the relationship between neighborhood design and rates of students walking and biking to elementary school. Design. Pairwise correlations and multiple regression models were estimated based on a cross-sectional study of elementary schools and their surrounding neighborhoods. Setting and Subjects. Thirty-four (23\%) of 150 California public elementary schools holding October 1999 Walk to School Day events participated in the study. Measures. Teachers asked ﬁfth-grade students how they arrived to school 1 week before Walk to School Day. 1990 U.S. Census data measured population density and number of intersections per street mile, whereas 1998–1999 California Department of Education data measured school size, the percentage of students receiving public welfare, and the percentage of students of various ethnicities.
Results. Population density (p ϭ .000) and school size (p ϭ .053) were signiﬁcantly associated with walking and biking rates in regression models controlling for number of intersections per street mile, the percentage of students receiving public welfare, and the percentage of students of various ethnicities. The number of intersections per street mile was associated with walking and biking rates in pairwise correlations (p ϭ .003) but not in regression models.
Conclusions. The results support the hypothesis that the walking and biking rates are higher in denser neighborhoods and to smaller schools but do not support the hypothesis that rates are higher in neighborhoods with a high number of intersections per street mile. We suggest that detailed data for a larger sample of students would allow statistical models to isolate the effect of speciﬁc design characteristics. (Am J Health Promot 2004;19[2]: 128–136.)},

However, the ﬁeld of transportation planning has little in the way of theory and methods to guide design and planning for walkable cities. Walkability is increasingly valued for a variety of reasons. Not only does pedestrian transportation reduce congestion and have low environmental impact, it has social and recreational value. Recent research suggests that walking also promotes mental and physical health. The quality of the pedestrian environment is key to encouraging people to choose walking over driving. Six criteria are presented for design of a successful pedestrian network: ͑1͒ connectivity; ͑2͒ linkage with other modes; ͑3͒ ﬁne grained land use patterns; ͑4͒ safety; ͑5͒ quality of path; and ͑6͒ path context. To achieve walkable cities in the United States it will be necessary to assess current walkability conditions, revise standards and regulations, research walking behavior in varied settings, promote public education and participation in pedestrian planning, and encourage collaboration and interdisciplinary education between transportation engineers and the design professions.},

	abstract = {Background:  Previous studies found a complex relationship between area-level socioeconomic status (SES) and walkability. These studies did not include neighborhood dynamics. Our aim was to study the association between area-level SES and walkability in the city of Madrid (Spain) evaluating the potential effect modification of neighborhood dynamics.
Methods:  All census sections of the city of Madrid (n = 2415) were included. Area-level SES was measured using a composite index of 7 indicators in 4 domains (education, wealth, occupation and living conditions). Two neighborhood dynamics factors were computed: gentrification, proxied by change in education levels in the previous 10 years, and neighborhood age, proxied by median year of construction of housing units in the area. Walkability was measured using a composite index of 4 indicators (Residential Density, Population Density, Retail Destinations and Street Connectivity). We modeled the association using linear mixed models with random intercepts.
Results:  Area-level SES and walkability were inversely and significantly associated. Areas with lower SES showed the highest walkability. This pattern did not hold for areas with an increase in education level, where the association was flat (no decrease in walkability with higher SES). Moreover, the association was attenuated in newly built areas: the association was stronger in areas built before 1975, weaker in areas built between 1975 and 1990 and flat in areas built from 1990 on.
Conclusion:  Areas with higher neighborhood socioeconomic status had lower walkability in Madrid. This disadvantage in walkability was not present in recently built or gentrified areas.},

The Pedestrian Environment Index (PEI) is deﬁned as the product of four components representing land-use diversity (based on the concept of entropy), population density, commercial density, and intersection density. The ﬁnal PEI is bound between 0 and 1, and uses data that typically are readily available to planners and metropolitan planning organizations (MPO). The results of this method are region-speciﬁc; they are comparable only between the zones within the given study area. As a case study, the city of Chicago is analyzed at the sub-trafﬁc analysis zone (sub-TAZ) level. The results agree closely with the expectation of pedestrian friendliness across different parts of the city. Possible extensions are also listed, including a further study to determine statistical relationships between the PEI and common socio-economic characteristics. The method could also be further improved should more types of data become available.},

We suggest that this work is not and cannot be empirical science but is based in the detailed observation of cities using multiple logics. While there is an emerging science of cities, urban design knowledge is much broader, spanning both natural and social sciences as well as the arts and humanities. We also argue that it is a particular form of diagrammatic socio-spatial knowledge that cannot be reduced to either words or numbers.

Wholeness is the global structural character of a given conﬁguration existing in space. According to Alexander, wholeness is measurable although we do not have a mathematical language to describe it yet. Some authors have proposed a network perspective to address this problem. However, it is still poorly developed. This paper discusses how to improve the network approach already suggested in the literature. The aim is contributing to the debate on how to operationalise Alexander’s theories through a network perspective. We check out different descriptive systems and different centrality measures, which can be used to reveal the spatial relationship between urban entities and its hierarchy. The main conclusion is that centrality measures seem to offer an opportunity to get closer to Alexander’s concepts. However, a key point to move forward is a deeper investigation on how to describe the urban elements, how to identify spatial differentiation, and how to visualize the results. The relevance of such kind of research is the possibility of using those insights as analytical methods for supporting urban design.},

We collect data from the location-based service Foursquare in The Netherlands and employ it to obtain a rich catalogue of restaurant locations and other urban amenities, as well as a measure of their popularity among users. Because the Foursquare data can be combined with traditional sources of socioeconomic data obtained from Statistics Netherlands, we can quantify, document and characterise some of the biases inherent in these new sources of data in the context of urban applications. A detailed analysis is given as to when this type of big data is useful and when it is misleading. Although the users of Foursquare are not representative of the whole population, we argue that this inherent bias can be exploited for research about the attractiveness of urban landscapes and consumer amenities in addition to the more traditional data on urban amenities.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of digital real estate technologies. Often referred to as PropTech (property technology), these innovations might variously promise more eﬃcient portfolio management (e.g. VTS), new ways to rent accommodation (e.g. Airbnb), or hassle-free maintenance (e.g. FixFlo). Whilst commentators have debated their novelty as either highly disruptive or a temporary fad, few researchers have sought to fully theorize the digital real estate platform. And those that have provided overviews of the so-called PropTech landscape have failed to do so in a suﬃciently critical manner, instead opting for a raft of essentialist and categorical terms. Borrowing the lenses of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and platform studies, this paper develops a theory of digital real estate platforms to address this conceptual gap. And through a qualitative analysis of some 400 businesses, it provides a series of key observations of Platform Real Estate as an improved theoretical neologism to inform future research. These observations are important to better understand the nature of digital real estate platforms and the manner in which they may reconstruct future urban real estate markets – a subject of great concern to researchers and market participants alike.},

Here, we are interested in grappling with the current ‘place’ of smart cities in the context of what seems to be an emerging platform urbanism, thereby highlighting a complex platform-based ecosystem encompassing private and public organisations and citizens. Our point of departure is the operationalization of three intertwined trends associated with the conceptualizations of participation, mediatisation and (multi-sided) platformisation. Through the examination of (social) traﬃc and navigation application, Waze, we explore manifestations of (contested) dynamics in mobility practices occurring between commerce and community in the public space of the city. The preliminary ﬁndings point to the emergence of new socio-spatial constructs which aﬀord a better frame of ‘what is going on’, challenging the smart city framework as a planning and development paradigm. In putting forward the notion of public value and ownership, it is our aim to prompt a critical debate about platform urbanism made explicit by a driving politics that oﬀers a window to a future driving world, urging cities and governments to anticipate and mitigate (un)intended consequences.},

	abstract = {Peer to Peer e-commerce is increasingly characterized by trends towards the personalization of buyers and sellers in the on-line marketplace. This personalization includes buyer reviews, personal pictures and proﬁles, and other biographical information intended to reduce buyers’ perceived “purchase risk” or to facilitate trust in the sellers. However, this phenomenon is transforming what started as an essentially “anonymous” market to one susceptible to traditional market failures, including potential racial discrimination, in a manner similar to its brick and mortar counterparts. In this paper, we examine the effect of on-line host information (race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) on the price of available rental listings in San Francisco on Airbnb.com. We ﬁnd that on average, Asian and Hispanic hosts charge 8\%-10\% lower prices relative to their White counterparts on equivalent rental properties, after controlling for all renteravailable information on rental unit characteristics, as well as additional information on neighborhood property values, area demographics, and occupancy rates. We do not ﬁnd any differences in occupancy rates between minority and White hosts. This may suggest that minorities price lower because they are forward-looking, perhaps due to an expectation of discrimination in the online marketplace or have a preference to increase demand to either maintain their target occupancy level or to attract a larger pool of potential renters to choose from. Overall, our ﬁndings are consistent with but not conclusive of a market test of potential racial discrimination affecting Hispanic Airbnb hosts, manifested in an anticipation of disparate market demand for their rentals, and responded to by lower listing prices.},

	abstract = {Many indicators of renter household insecurity remain widespread or have shown signs of worsening in the past decade, including unaﬀordability, poor unit conditions, overcrowding, and evictions. Most research to date has examined each of these conditions as a standalone problem, without examining the extent and severity of simultaneously occurring housing problems. This study closes that gap by examining the suitability of measuring housing insecurity as an index of multiple variables within four identiﬁed dimensions: unaﬀordability, poor conditions, overcrowding, and forced moves. Results show that dimensions of housing insecurity are highly correlated and suitable for measurement as an index. The proposed index shows that housing insecurity is widespread among U.S. renters, but varies greatly in severity and type.},

	abstract = {This paper makes an initial contribution towards building a polycentricity index to account for the governing of social–ecological systems. It develops three indices and an overall index, using an approach based on network science, to measure the extent to which actors develop ordered relationships to address scale mismatches in urban water governance. These indices are discussed with respect to the overarching system of rules governing actors’ decisions within the Middle Rio Grande (MRG) urban watershed. The analysis and discussions herein suggest that the governance of the MRG is a predominantly monocentric governing system with elements of polycentricity. They also suggest that polycentricity in governing the MRG urban water commons could primarily be about the politics of power and resource distribution as actors reconfigure their positionalities and align themselves and their interests strategically. The paper concludes with a succinct discussion about how quantitative measures of an overarching system of rules could be incorporated into future indices.},

Evidence-based practice proposes a better connection between research and professional work, but raises several concerns about the character of valid evidence, the strength and clarity of planning research, and inequalities in the available resources for integrating research into planning practice. Much of planning practice is a reﬂective craft where skills of mediation, negotiation, listening, and framing are prominent. As part of the planner’s work employing these skills, however, there is a valuable role for research-generated evidence to inform decision making. Evidence-based practice needs careful implementation but it can enrich the ﬁeld of planning by linking research to practice.},

	abstract = {Over the last fifty years, research into street networks has gained prominence with a rapidly growing number of studies across disparate disciplines. These studies investigate a wide range of phenomena using a wealth of data and diverse analytical techniques. Starting within the fields of transport or infrastructure engineering, street networks have commonly been treated as sets of more or less homogeneous linear elements, connecting locations and intersecting at junctions. This view is commonly represented as a graph, which provides a common and rigorous formalisation accessible across disciplines and is particularly well-suited for problems such as flow optimisation and routing. Street networks are, however, complex objects of investigation and the way we model and then represent them as graphs has fundamental effects on the outcomes of a study. Many approaches to modelling street networks have been proposed, each lending itself to different analyses and supporting insights into diverse aspects of the urban system. Yet, this plurality and the relation between different models remains relatively obscure and unexplored. The motivations for adopting a given model of the network are also not always clear and often seem to follow disciplinary traditions. This paper provides an overview of key street network models and the prima facie merits of pertinent alternative approaches. It suggests greater attention to consistent use of terms and concepts, of graph representations and practical applications, and concludes with suggestions for possible ways forward.},

	doi = {10.1177/0308518X18820917},
	abstract = {This article responds to Peck’s call for a heterodox economic analysis of markets that is sensitive to their sociality and spatiality with Polanyi’s work as a starting point. It is argued that while Polanyi’s concept of the socially embedded economy offers a useful heuristic for apprehending the social foundations of economic activity, his analysis exhibits ‘market fetishism’ – a tendency to treat markets as things in and of themselves, without a proper appreciation of their inherently social foundations – and that this is reflected in broader scholarly discourses with respect to markets. Thus, it is argued, we need to augment Polanyi’s framework with other heterodox economic insights. The article outlines a four-step approach to ‘de-fetishizing’ markets. First, the article foregrounds the specifically capitalist nature of the global economy, and the ‘unique system of market dependence’ to which capitalist social relations give rise. Second, it is argued that de-fetishizing markets requires that an agent-centred approach be adopted. Rather than viewing markets as ‘things’ it is argued that they are most usefully understood as the interactions between agents, the most significant of which, within the contemporary global economy, is the large capitalist firm. Third, the interaction between such agents is structured by pervasive frameworks of rules. Fourth, it is argued that markets are inherently spatial phenomena. They are spatially constituted and contribute to the production of space.},

These components resonate with the formal categories articulated by Kevin Lynch. That is to say, New Urbanist projects emphasize defined streets (edges) neighborhood coherence (districts) civic buildings (landmarks) connective public open spaces (nodes) and gridiron street networks (paths). Lynch, however, deemed that such urban features arose from dynamic processes, whereas New Urbanists pre-designate formal features without full consideration of their functional dynamics. In order to better situate this notion of ‘functional dynamics’, this paper argues that urban settings can be considered as examples of complex adaptive systems (CAS). The paper re-purposes Lynch’s formal categories to discuss CAS dynamics in urban settings, with processes rather than forms providing the essential mechanisms with which to achieve the conviviality NU projects aspire to.},

Combining both perspectives, we identify the benefits of tighter integration between Geography and Data Science and argue for the establishment of a new space—that we term Geographic Data Science—in which cross‐pollination could occur to the benefit of both Geography and the larger data community.},

This paper takes its inspiration from both the review articles of Barthelemy in Phys Rep, 499, 1–101, 2011, and of Ducruet and Beauguitte in Netw Spatial Econ, 14, 297–316, 2014, and attempts to provide an integrated epistemological consideration for the complex study in the scientific subfield of spatial networks. Within the concept of epistemology, which is the theory examining the ways that knowledge is being achievable, the major research question that is tried to be answered in this paper is Bwhether there is convergence or divergence in the evolution of the spatial networks’ study, in terms of cognition, methods, and applications{\textasciicircum}. The further purpose of this paper is to shape an integrated methodological framework for the study of spatial networks, incorporating the existing structural, functional and socioeconomic approaches. The overall consideration aspires to contribute to the comprehension and the standardization of the procedures in the analysis of spatial networks, to promote the interdisciplinary research of complex networks, and to introduce the dialogue about how Complex Network Analysis (CNA) and NS can move methodically from the research field into the academic didactics.},

This paper is built upon three successive sections within that perspective. Firstly, dominating paradigms surpassed in each period and restructured planning theory throughout the planning history will be explained. Then, theoretical and practical differentiations on urban regeneration process will be investigated by evaluating the planning approaches, strategies and models on urban change in each period. Finally, as a response to neo-liberal challenges on the contemporary historic preservation and urban conservation agenda, a strategic model integrating theory, practice and method in its framework will be proposed by comparing similarities and differences in organizational and spatial levels on the issue of urban regeneration. Conclusively, this paper underlines the need for systematizing an integrated, strategic, multi-agent and collaborative model unifying theory, practice and method in its framework for planning, managing and sustaining the urban regeneration process by releasing a debate on the contemporary neo-liberal conjuncture in which the political, economical and planning paradigms on urban development and change are conjoined competitively in global cities.},

For ontological reasons, critical realism considers that interdisciplinary integration is necessary to arrive at valid knowledge, whereas competing positions such as positivism and poststructuralism tend to neglect important parts of reality. Critical realism acknowledges the independent causal powers of both agents and structures and thus provides a suitable platform for investigating causal relationships between social conditions, spatial urban structures and the actions of agents (including those of planners). Moreover, a critical realist view on the possibilities of research-based predictions squares well with the qualitative impact assessments of alternative solutions and the modest, context-adapted estimates of magnitudes of effects typical within urban planning.},

The heterogeneous geography of broadband infrastructure and investments results in variable service provision, and as such, there exist large disparities in access and performance within different spatio-temporal locations. This paper presents analysis of 4.7 million crowdsourced Internet speed test results that were compiled between 2010 and 2013 alongside various indicators of socio-spatial structure to map disparities in English broadband speed between and within urban areas. Although average speeds have improved over time, inequity is shown to emerge between different societal groups and locations. Short-term dynamics also reveal that in areas of different density, speeds can fall dramatically during peak hours, thus inﬂuencing the availability of services. The apparent disparities in access and performance represent a major issue as Internet use becomes increasingly ubiquitous in our everyday lives, with inequalities evoking social and economic disadvantage at local and national scales. This work resonates with UK government policy that has stimulated considerable investment in improving infrastructure, and presents analysis of an expansive crowd sourced “big data” resource for the ﬁrst time.},

It included the first experiment that tests whether two types of light-touch incentives induce opportunity moves for HCV recipients who had requested a moving voucher. Based on the 2,005 HCV recipients in the study, we found that neither the offer of a \$500 grant nor the offer of a \$500 grant coupled with free mobility counseling induced opportunity moves. The receipt of mobility counseling also did not boost opportunity moves. Regardless of the type of offer, 11\%–12\% of participants moved to opportunity neighborhoods. Despite requesting a moving voucher, half of the study participants remained in place, indicating significant barriers to moving. We offer potential reasons for the results and conclude with two recommended pilots to increase opportunity moves.},

It does so through utilising a future-orientated lens to sketch out the kinds of work required to reimagine, reframe and remake smart cities. I argue that, on the one hand, there is a need to produce an alternative ‘future present’ that shifts the anticipatory logics of smart cities to that of addressing persistent inequalities, prejudice, and discrimination, and is rooted in notions of fairness, equity, ethics and democracy. On the other hand, there is a need to disrupt the ‘present future’ of neoliberal smart urbanism, moving beyond minimal politics to enact sustained strategic, public-led interventions designed to create more-inclusive smart city initiatives. Both tactics require producing a deeply normative vision for smart cities that is rooted in ideas of citizenship, social justice, the public good, and the right to the city that needs to be developed in conjunction with citizens.},

	abstract = {As a strategic factor for a country to survive in the global competition, transportation systems have attracted extensive attention from different disciplines for a long time. Since the introduction of complex network theory in the last decade, however, studies on transport systems have witnessed dramatic progress. Most roads, streets, and rails are organized as a network pattern, while link ﬂows, travel time, or geographical distance are regarded as weights. In this article, the authors will present the current state of topological research on transportation systems under a complex network framework, as well as the efforts and challenges that have been made in the last decade. First, different kinds of transportation systems should be generalized as networks in different ways, which will be explained in the ﬁrst part of this paper. We follow this by summarizing network measures that describe topological characteristics of transportation networks. Then we discuss the empirical observations from the last decade on real transportation systems at a variety of spatial scales. This paper concludes with some important challenges and open research frontiers in this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {The science of complexity is based on a new way of thinking that stands in sharp contrast to the philosophy underlying Newtonian science, which is based on reductionism, determinism, and objective knowledge. This paper reviews the historical development of this new world view, focusing on its philosophical foundations. Determinism was challenged by quantum mechanics and chaos theory. Systems theory replaced reductionism by a scientifically based holism. Cybernetics and postmodern social science showed that knowledge is intrinsically subjective. These developments are being integrated under the header of “complexity science”. Its central paradigm is the multi-agent system. Agents are intrinsically subjective and uncertain about their environment and future, but out of their local interactions, a global organization emerges. Although different philosophers, and in particular the postmodernists, have voiced similar ideas, the paradigm of complexity still needs to be fully assimilated by philosophy. This will throw a new light on old philosophical issues such as relativism, ethics and the role of the subject.},

Scholars present three main arguments against the smart city: that it is incompatible with an informal character of the city, that it subjects the city to corporate power and that it reproduces social and urban inequalities. It is argued that these critiques either misunderstand how power functions in the smart city or fail to address it as a specific modality of entrepreneurial urban governance. The second part advances an alternative critique, contending that the smart city should be understood as an urban embodiment of the society of control (Deleuze). The smart city is embedded in the intellectual framework of second order cybernetics and articulates urban subjectivity in terms of data flows. Planning as a political practice is superseded by an environmental-behavioural control, in which subjectivity is articulated supra-individually (permeating the city with sensing nodes) and infra-individually (making citizens into sensing nodes).},

	doi = {10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734},
	abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science”programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts fieldby-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

We focus on the long-term nature of infrastructure decisions, speciﬁcally local roadways, which can lock in greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. The location and interconnectedness of local roadways form a nearpermanent backbone for the future layout of land parcels, buildings, and transportation options. We provide new estimates of the environmental impact of low-connectivity roads, characterized by cul-de-sacs and T-intersections, which we dub street-network sprawl. We ﬁnd an elasticity of vehicle ownership with respect to street connectivity of –0.15—larger than suggested by previous research. We then apply this estimate to quantify the long-term emissions implications of alternative scenarios for street-network sprawl. On current trends alone, we project vehicle travel and emissions to fall by ∼3.2\% over the 2015–2050 period, compared to a scenario where sprawl plateaus at its 1994 peak. Concerted policy efforts to increase street connectivity could more than triple these reductions to ∼8.8\% by 2050. Longer-term reductions over the 2050–2100 period are more speculative, but could be more than 50\% greater than those achieved by 2050. The longer the timescale over which mitigation efforts are considered, the more important it becomes to address the physical form of the built environment.},

In the past, dominant patterns of urban form have emerged in such regions at different historical periods. These morphological phases include mid 19th-century grids, streetcar suburb grids, garden suburbs, automobile suburbs and New Urbanist neighbourhoods (which have only recently made an appearance and may or may not become widespread). Judging by the performance of past types of urban morphology, ﬁve design values appear particularly important for more sustainable urban form in the future: compactness, contiguity, connectivity, diversity and ecological integration. Although these principles were not well supported by 20th-century development, contemporary movements such as the New Urbanism and Smart Growth re-emphasise them. The example of these two regions indicates that, in the absence of new technological, economic or geographical forces, public sector institutions and urban social movements represent the most likely means to bring about new, more sustainable types of urban form.},

I detect significant, robust increases in values for transactions on parcels that received a boost in allowed building size. I also identify value increases for residential condominiums, indicating that upzoning increased prices of existing housing units. I find no impacts of the reforms, however, on the number of newly permitted dwellings over five years.

HUD recently implemented Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs), based on ZIP Code-level rents, to improve options for voucher recipients in high-opportunity areas. I use a proprietary dataset of for-rent listings to test the ways in which SAFMRs would change the number of listings below FMR across five California HUD metropolitan FMR areas—Oakland-Fremont, Sacramento--Roseville--Arden-Arcade, San Diego-Carlsbad, San Francisco, and San Jose-Sunnyvale, Santa Clara. I examine local housing authorities' concerns regarding the SAFMRs. I find the SAFMRs will increase the number of listings below FMR in high-opportunity neighborhoods across each area studied except San Francisco. I confirm Oakland housing authorities' concerns that the SAFMRs would reduce the number of units below FMR in areas with rapidly rising rents. I find that Sacramento and San Diego may benefit most from the SAFMRs among those studied. These findings validate HUD's criteria for identifying areas in which to implement the SAFMRs, as Sacramento and San Diego are also the only two areas among the case studies in this article that HUD initially approved for SAFMRs implementation. The SAFMRs highlight the importance of geographic scale in housing policy implementation.]},

	abstract = {Volunteered geographic information (VGI) contains valuable ﬁeld observations that represent the spatial distribution of geographic phenomena. As such, it has the potential to provide regularly updated low-cost ﬁeld samples for predictively mapping the spatial variations of geographic phenomena. The predictive mapping of geographic phenomena often requires representative samples for high mapping accuracy, but samples consisting of VGI observations are often not representative as they concentrate on speciﬁc geographic areas (i.e. spatial bias) due to the opportunistic nature of voluntary observation eﬀorts. In this article, we propose a representativeness-directed approach to mitigate spatial bias in VGI for predictive mapping. The proposed approach deﬁnes and quantiﬁes sample representativeness by comparing the probability distributions of sample locations and the mapping area in the environmental covariate space. Spatial bias is mitigated by weighting the sample locations to maximize their representativeness. The approach is evaluated using species habit suitability mapping as a case study. The results show that the accuracy of predictive mapping using weighted sample locations is higher than using unweighted sample locations. A positive relationship between sample representativeness and mapping accuracy is also observed, suggesting that sample representativeness is a valid indicator of predictive mapping accuracy. This approach mitigates spatial bias in VGI to improve predictive mapping accuracy.},

	abstract = {This article centers the role of digital technologies in extending financial accumulation into new sectors of the US housing market in the wake of the global financial crisis. I argue that while post-crisis market conditions provided an opportunity for large investors to acquire foreclosed single-family homes, convert them to rental housing, and roll out an new asset class based on bundled rent checks, these conditions were insufficient on their own. Digital innovations coming to prominence since the 2008 crisis were required to automate core functions, such as rent collection and maintenance, in order to efficiently manage large, geographically dispersed property portfolios. New information technologies enabled investors to aggregate ownership of resources, extract income flows, and securely convey these flows to capital markets. Such advances have, therefore, given rise to the “automated landlord”, whereby the management of tenants and properties is increasingly not only mediated, but governed, by smartphones, digital platforms, and apps, and the data and analytics these devices and infrastructures gather and enable. This article shows how technological transformations actively participate in the ongoing, dynamic process of financial accumulation strategies, and contends that digital technologies, therefore, also comprise a crucial terrain of struggles over housing’s place in contemporary capitalism.},

The ﬁndings suggest landlords have preferences about tenants and make decisions based on signals communicated in inquiry emails from potential applicants.

These discrimination patterns are generally consistent with the theory of agent-based statistical discrimination.

	doi = {10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.12.030},
	abstract = {National land use policies and strategies worldwide have attempted to establish a healthy housing rental market towards urban sustainability. Monitoring fine-scale housing rental prices should provide essential implications for equitable housing policies. However, doing so remains a challenge because aggregated data were traditionally collected at a coarse scale through census or social surveys. On-line housing rental websites (OHRWs) have become popular social media platforms in the housing studies. This paper attempts to demonstrate how to monitor fine-scale housing rental prices based on OHRWs using the case of Shenzhen in China. Employing hedonic model, a set of housing rental determinants are initially selected from three characteristics (neighborhood, location and structure) and at three levels (nearest accessibility, 15-minute walking distance availability and sub-district availability). Housing rent prediction models are then established (respectively for October 2017 and February 2018) using the training samples collected from the OHRWs and six machinelearning algorithms, including random forest regression (RFR), extra-trees regression (ETR), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and knearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). Thereafter, the relative importance of the determinants is calculated and visualized using partial dependence plots. Finally, the models are used to monitor housing rental price dynamics for all of the communities within Shenzhen. Results show that all of the algorithms except SVR generally present good performance. Among them, RFR and ETR are the best one in October 2017 and February 2018, respectively. Concerning the spatial pattern of housing rental, the high-high clusters merge in the central districts, whereas the low-low clusters are located in the outskirts, and the growth rate is the greatest in the farthest outskirts from the central districts. Each determinant affects the housing rent across different scale and subdistrict availability and nearest accessibility are more important than 15-minute walking distance availability. The two most influential determinants are sub-district job opportunity and nearest accessibility to health care facilities. The case of Shenzhen shows that the demonstrated framework, which integrates machine-learning algorithms and the hedonic modeling, is practical and efficient. The approach is believed to provide an essential tool to inform equitable housing policies.},

Across cycles, two tropes repeatedly appear: discourses of efficiency, that propose technological solutions to urban problems, and those of beauty, that turn to nature to improve social arrangements through design. Within cycles, reform discourses follow a similar pattern in each case: they roll out amidst the excitement of an emergent socio-technical paradigm, but, used as guidelines for its institutionalization, create new social problems even as they aim to remedy the old. In each wave planners and decision-makers try to out-engineer and out-design inequality (and other social problems), and each time they fail. We use this analytic to historicize the contemporary ‘smart’ and ‘sustainable’ city, arguing that it is only the latest in a series of beauty and efficiency solutions to urban problems, and its promises should be taken with more than a grain of salt.},

	abstract = {Cities are complex, perhaps one of the most complex kinds of structure created by humans. Some cities have been planned to a large extent while others have grown organically. The outcome of planning and growth processes is the diverse morphological built form and street patterns observed in cities today. So far, in urban planning and history research, cities are classiﬁed as planned or organic, largely based on the visual assessment of their urban morphology. To understand cities and their characteristics, it is necessary to develop methods that quantitatively describe these characteristics and enable objective comparisons between cities. Using graph representations of the street network of cities, it is possible to calculate measures that seem to exhibit patterns with scale-free properties (Jiang in Phys A Stat Mech Appl 384(2):647–655, 2007). And thanks to progress in the ﬁeld of complexity studies, it is also possible to test if and to what extent the distribution of a measure in a collection of elements ﬁts a power law distribution (Clauset et al. in SIAM Rev 51:43, 2009). In this chapter, we show that the degree distribution of a city’s street network seems to ﬁt a power law distribution for cities that are considered to have mostly grown organically. On the other hand, cities that are planned to a large extent do not exhibit such a good ﬁt. This result is relevant since a power law distribution is a signature of multiplicative growth processes. Furthermore, the result of the quantitative classiﬁcation method correlates well with the results of earlier qualitative morphological classiﬁcations of cities.},

	abstract = {Urban morphology investigates the physical form of the city and the historical processes behind its formation. Together with the qualitative analysis, the founding fathers of urban morphology also proposed quantitative measures of urban form. Urban morphologists have traditionally resisted computer-based geoprocessing of urban form and their calculations were mainly carried out manually. Thanks to technological developments, the number of quantitative studies in urban morphology has increased and fully integrated geoprocessing. More sophisticated computer-aided analyses enhance the potential applications in urban design and in environmental psychology research. Space Syntax (Hillier 1998) and Multiple Centrality Assessment (Porta et al. 2006) are configurational, multi-scale approaches to the analysis of the urban street networks, but miss the interplay between streets, building and parcels composing urban fabric. Space Matrix (Berghauser Pont and Haupt 2010) and, more recently, Multiple Fabric Assessment (Araldi and Fusco 2017) are geoprocessing quantitative approaches to the analysis of urban fabric morphology. This study has two aims; (1) classify quantitative urban morphology methods and (2) discuss how these methods could be applied in urban design and environmental psychology. First, we will present the evolution of these methods along with the theories in urban morphology from qualitative to quantitative approaches. Then, we will discuss how these methods could be combined and used in two related areas: urban design and environmental psychology.},

	abstract = {Urban forms at human-scale, i.e., urban environments that individuals can sense (e.g., sight, smell, and touch) in their daily lives, can provide unprecedented insights on a variety of applications, such as urban planning and environment auditing. The analysis of urban forms can help planners develop high-quality urban spaces through evidence-based design. However, such analysis is complex because of the involvement of spatial, multi-scale (i.e., city, region, and street), and multivariate (e.g., greenery and sky ratios) natures of urban forms. In addition, current methods either lack quantitative measurements or are limited to a small area. The primary contribution of this work is the design of StreetVizor, an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms based on street view images. Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 1) an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest (AOIs) at city- and region-scales; 2) and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the ﬁne-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale. We integrate visualization techniques with machine learning models to facilitate the detection of street view patterns. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with case studies on the real-world datasets of four cities, i.e., Hong Kong, Singapore, Greater London and New York City. Interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in facilitating various analytical tasks.},

In this article, we build on a synergy of urban simulation, urban visualization, and computer graphics to automatically infer an urban layout for any time step of the simulation sequence. In addition to standard visualization tools, our method gathers data of the original street network, parcels, and aerial imagery and uses the available simulation results to infer changes to the original urban layout. Our method produces a new and plausible layout for the simulation results. In contrast with previous work, our approach automatically updates the layout based on changes in the simulation data and thus can scale to a large simulation over many years. The method in this article offers a substantial step forward in building integrated visualization and behavioral simulation systems for use in community visioning, planning, and policy analysis. We demonstrate our method on several real cases using a 200 GB database for a 16,300 km2 area surrounding Seattle, Washington.},

To this end, this paper looks at the smart cities debate from the perspectives of, on the one hand, citizens’ awareness of applications and solutions that are considered ‘smart’ and, on the other hand, their ability to use these applications and solutions. Drawing from a detailed analysis of the outcomes of a pilot international study, this paper showcases that even the most educated users of smart city services, i.e., those arguably most aware of and equipped with skills to use these services effectively, express very serious concerns regarding the utility, safety, accessibility and efﬁciency of those services. This suggests that more pragmatism needs to be included in smart cities research if its ﬁndings are to remain useful and relevant for all stakeholders involved. The discussion in this paper contributes to the smart cities debate in three ways. First, it adds empirical support to the thesis of ‘normative bias’ of smart cities research. Second, it suggests ways of bypassing it, thereby opening a debate on the preconditions of sustainable interdisciplinary smart cities research. Third, it points to new avenues of research.},

	abstract = {Fast urbanization is a common feature of many developing human societies. In many cases, past and present, explosive population growth in cities outstrips the rate of provision of housing and urban services and leads to the formation of informal settlements or slums. Slums are extremely varied in terms of their histories, infrastructure, and rates of change, but they share certain common features: informal land use, lack of physical accesses, and nonexistent or poor quality urban services. Currently, about 1 billion people worldwide live in slums, a number that could triple by 2050 if no practical solutions are enacted to reverse this trend. Underlying most problems of slums is the issue of lack of physical accesses to places of work and residence. This prevents residents and businesses from having an address, obtaining basic services such as water and sanitation, and being helped in times of emergency. Here, we show how the physical layout of any neighborhood can be classified quantitatively in terms of its access topology in a way that is independent of its geometry. Topological indices capturing levels of access to structures within a city block can then be used to define a constrained optimization problem, whose solution generates an access network that makes each structure in the settlement accessible to services with minimal disruption and cost. We discuss the general applicability of these techniques to several informal settlements in developing cities and demonstrate various technical aspects of our solutions. Finally, we discuss how these techniques could be used on a large scale to speed up human development processes in cities throughout the world while respecting their local identity and history.},

As a consequence, cities are beginning to grapple with creating regulatory regimes for managing this new land use and its encroachments on residential areas. This article uses webscraped data from Airbnb, the industry leader, to analyze the geographical patterns and concentrations of these impacts in ﬁve US cities: Austin, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. It uses the ﬁndings to put forth four general principles for cities seeking to manage impacts imposed by Airbnb and its competitors. These are that webscraping is an imperfect but relatively cheap and eﬀective means of gathering locally speciﬁc data; that “spiky” usage patterns dictate a microgeographic approach to regulation; that meaningful regulation necessitates dedicated enforcement, likely paid for with permit fees; and that it is desirable to distinguish between “mom-and-pop” hosts and those operating at a commercial scale.},

As a result, the design of the program limits a voucher household’s access to opportunity neighborhood. In response, HUD created the Small Area Fair Market Rent (SAFMR) demonstration program, which calculates the maximum voucher rent at the zip code level so that HUD’s rent limits more closely align with local neighborhood rents. In theory, this program should improve a voucher household’s choice set and location outcomes. Looking at changes in the location of beneﬁciaries in the six sites that participated in the SAFMR demonstration program, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant amount of regional variation in the results. Speciﬁcally, introduction of the SAFMR rent calculations results in voucher households living in higher opportunity neighborhoods in Dallas, Texas, in lower opportunity neighborhoods in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and mixed eﬀects in other areas. These mixed results highlight some of the potential incremental beneﬁts of the program and reinforce the importance of viewing this policy over a longer period of time, and in the context of other constraints voucher households face in accessing neighborhood opportunity.},

It begins with a discussion of how to measure stable racial integration in neighborhoods. Then, examining data from 34 metropolitan areas, it shows that while integrated neighborhoods containing blacks and whites are considerably less stable than more homogeneous communities, a mujority remain integrated over time. Moreover, integration appears to be growing more viable, with racially integrated communities more likely to be stable during the 1980s than during the previous decade. The growing prevalence of stable, racially integrated neighborhoods is an importantfact, running counter to the popular, and often self-julfilling, view that integration is unviable. These communities offer important research opportunities as well. A better understanding of the circumstances under which racial integration seems to succeed will ultimately shed light on the causes ofAmerica’s undeniably extreme level of segregation.},

We ﬁnd that smaller samples do not offer an accurate picture of peripheral activity; we also ﬁnd that the bias is greater for the network of mentions, partly because of the higher inﬂuence of snowballing in identifying relevant nodes. We discuss the implications of this bias for the study of diffusion dynamics and political communication through social media, and advocate the need for more uniform sampling procedures to study online communication.},

Our results quantify how much vehicle miles traveled can be expected to change in response to changes in policy or land use factors, including residential density and land use mix, as well as speciﬁc transport policies and programs such as transit improvements, road pricing, and programs aimed at changing people’s travel choices. Overall, though individual studies differ as to exact effect sizes, it is clear that local-level policymakers can take actions that are likely to affect vehicle miles traveled. However, we highlight gaps in the knowledge base at a time when decision makers at the local level are being increasingly called upon to take action to reduce vehicle miles traveled. Variation in effect size based on local context or interaction with related policies and programs has been left largely unexplored. In addition, experimental research designs that can identify causal direction are rare, and appropriate data that quantiﬁes vehicle miles traveled are often lacking.},

	abstract = {Agent-Based Model (ABM) is a promising tool for city-scale traffic simulation to understand the complex behaviour of the entire urban transportation system under different scenarios. In the ABM, traffic is intuitively simulated as movements and interactions between large numbers of agents, each capable of finding the route for an individual traveller or vehicle. This paper presents such an ABM development to reproduce the traffic patterns of the city of San Francisco. The model features a detailed road network and hour-long simulation time step to capture realistic variations in traffic conditions. Agent speed is determined according to a simplified volume-delay macroscopic relationship, which is more efficient than applying microscopic rules (e.g., car following) for evaluating city-scale traffic conditions. Two particular challenges of building such an ABM are addressed in this paper: data availability and computational cost. The key inputs to the ABM are sourced from standard and publicly available datasets, including the travel demand surveys published by local transport authorities and the road network data from the OpenStreetMap. In addition, an efficient priority-queue based Dijkstra algorithm is implemented to overcome the computational bottleneck of agent routing. The ABM is designed to run on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, thereby improving the computational speed significantly. Preliminary validation of the ABM is conducted by comparing its results with a published model. Overall, the ABM has been demonstrated to run efficiently and produce reliable results.},

This paper aims to introduce clinicians and citizen scientists to the possibilities offered by open source softwares (R and Python) for analyzing geospatial data. It is hoped that this introduction will stimulate interest in the ﬁeld as well as generate ideas for improving stroke services. Method: Instructions on installation of libraries for R and Python, source codes and links to census data are provided in a notebook format to enhance experience with running the software. The code illustrates different aspects of using geospatial analysis: (1) creation of choropleth (thematic) map which depicts estimate of stroke cases per post codes; (2) use of map to help deﬁne service regions for rehabilitation after stroke. Results: Choropleth map showing estimate of stroke per post codes and service boundary map for rehabilitation after stroke. Conclusions The examples in this article illustrate the use of a range of components that underpin geospatial analysis.

	abstract = {Street networks may be planned according to clear organizing principles or they may evolve organically through accretion, but their configurations and orientations help define a city’s spatial logic and order. Measures of entropy reveal a city’s streets’ order and disorder. Past studies have explored individual cases of orientation and entropy, but little is known about broader patterns and trends worldwide. This study examines street network orientation, configuration, and entropy in 100 cities around the world using OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx. It measures the entropy of street bearings in weighted and unweighted network models, along with each city’s typical street segment length, average circuity, average node degree, and the network’s proportions of four-way intersections and dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of orientation-order that quantifies how a city’s street network follows the geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed to explore similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple dimensions. Significant statistical relationships exist between city orientation-order and other indicators of spatial order, including street circuity and measures of connectedness. On average, US/Canadian study sites are far more grid-like than those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and circuity. These indicators, taken in concert, help reveal the extent and nuance of the grid. These methods demonstrate automatic, scalable, reproducible tools to empirically measure and visualize city spatial order, illustrating complex urban transportation system patterns and configurations around the world.},

	abstract = {As the rental housing market moves online, the internet offers divergent possible futures: either the promise of more-equal access to information for previously marginalized homeseekers, or a reproduction of longstanding information inequalities. Biases in online listings’ representativeness could impact different communities’ access to housing search information, reinforcing traditional information segregation patterns through a digital divide. They could also circumscribe housing practitioners’ and researchers’ ability to draw broad market insights from listings to understand rental supply and affordability. This study examines millions of Craigslist rental listings across the USA and finds that they spatially concentrate and overrepresent whiter, wealthier, and bettereducated communities. Other significant demographic differences exist in age, language, college enrollment, rent, poverty rate, and household size. Most cities’ online housing markets are digitally segregated by race and class, and we discuss various implications for residential mobility, community legibility, gentrification, housing voucher utilization, and automated monitoring and analytics in the smart cities paradigm. While Craigslist contains valuable crowdsourced data to better understand affordability and available rental supply in real time, it does not evenly represent all market segments. The internet promises information democratization, and online listings can reduce housing search costs and increase choice sets. However, technology access/preferences and information channel segregation can concentrate such information-broadcasting benefits in already-advantaged communities, reproducing traditional inequalities and reinforcing residential sorting and segregation dynamics. Technology platforms like Craigslist construct new institutions with the power to shape spatial economies, human interactions, and planners’ ability to monitor and respond to urban challenges.},

The core package provides data structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs, including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel edges and self-loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any (hashable) Python object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility makes NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in many different scientific fields. In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph formats for easy exchange with existing data, and provides generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the Erdos-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work studying synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how NetworkX enables research in the field of computational networks.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a new measure of rental affordability to estimate the growing mismatch between changes in rent and income. Quartiles defined in 2000 for each area are updated for inflation and then used to describe rent and income distributions in 2016, comparing the 50 largest metropolitan areas with census and American Community Survey (ACS) data. The features and advantages of this constant quartile mismatch (CQM) indicator are compared with alternative indicators of affordability, including excessive rent burden and low-income housing supply gap. Unlike the other indicators, rent and income changes are separately identified, which explains the curious anomaly that the San Francisco or Washington, D.C., areas have been measured more affordable than the national average. The mismatch indicator in contrast measures growing stress on renters at both the high and low ends of the distribution. Strong upward shifts in rents are unmatched by increases in incomes in the top quartile, whereas losses of rentals in the bottom quartile leave low-income renters with much less opportunity than they had before. The new method thus conveys how the affordability problems in the lower end of the housing market are linked to shifts in the upper quartile and directly to losses in the bottom quartile. This broader characterization of affordability could help build broader based support for solving housing problems.},

Classic urban form visualizations – from Giambattista Nolli’s ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs’s ﬁgure-ground diagrams of city streets – have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workﬂows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data oﬀer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workﬂows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and conﬁgurations in diﬀerent study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric. The age of ubiquitous urban data and computational toolkits opens up a new era of worldwide urban form analysis from integrated quantitative and qualitative perspectives.},

However, the participation practices in the real world, with its face-to-face politics of difference and unequal power relations, are flawed. Today, technology allows for an entirely new generation of forms and practices of public participation that promise to elevate the public discourse in an unprecedented manner while providing an interactive, networked environment for decision-making. This is occurring with asynchronous communities interacting with one another on a variety of planning subjects, which allows for more democratic planning and more meaningful participation. In this paper, we review the ways in which today’s web-based virtual worlds, like Facebook and Second Life, provide platforms for public participation in planning in a manner distinct from previous formats. We explore the different ways that citizens and communities are using web-based technologies for citizen participation, including the use of Facebook for community organizing around planning issues and of Second Life for virtual workshops. We include case studies of communities that are using these tools. The paper concludes by exploring the contribution that virtual participation can make to planning and examines the challenges that it poses.},

	abstract = {Cities and towns in the Americas and Europe bear the mark of what became known as the innovation of Hippodamus of Miletus. During the 24 centuries since its introduction, founders of new settlements readily applied the Hippodamian grid. However, its enduring prominence declined at the start of the 20th century when alternatives, intended to accommodate the new motor vehicles, were explored. While cities still struggle to absorb the shock of mechanized transportation, the Hippodamian concept is experiencing a renaissance. It gives cities clear structure, comprehensible order, modularity and expandability, among other qualities. Moreover, it is hypothesized that since current mobility devices have all but eclipsed the natural mode of travel—on foot—a return to the grid could reinstate walking as a viable option. It is clearly time for a fundamental re-evaluation of the Hippodamian idea in the context of the dominant automotive mobility and of the quest for walking as an alternative. This paper examines Hippodamus’ concept in its historical context and attempts to reformulate it in a contemporary planning framework that encourages walking.},

Numerous quality issues have been discussed in the vast literature, while the fitness of OSM for road navigability is only partly explored. Navigability depends on logical consistency, which focuses on the existence of logical contradictions within a data set. Researchers have discussed the insufficiency of established methods and the lack of a computational paradigm to assess the quality of the OSM data. To address the research gaps, the current work extended the capabilities of the Quantum GIS Processing Toolbox for assessment of spatial data. The models and scripts developed are able to assess logical consistency based on geographical topological consistency, semantic information, and morphological consistency. The established and proxy indicators are selected for measuring the logical consistency of OSM data for navigability. For empirical validation, OSM Punjab data are compared with authoritative data from HERE (proprietary) and the Remote Sensing Centre (RSC), Punjab, India. The results conclude that even the proprietary road data sets are not free from logical inconsistencies and data contributed by the masses are credible and navigable. OSM has produced better results than the RSC, but needs more crowd contributions to improve its quality.},

Researches integrating geographical processes in machine learning models and the use of unsupervised approaches on geographical data for knowledge discovery had been sparse. This research contributes to the ladder, where we show how latent variables learned from unsupervised learning methods on urban images can be used for geographic knowledge discovery. In particular, we propose a simple approach called Convolutional-PCA (ConvPCA) which are applied on both street level and street network images to find a set of uncorrelated and ordered visual latent components. The approach allows for meaningful explanations using a combination of geographical and generative visualisations to explore the latent space, and to show how the learned representation can be used to predict urban characteristics such as street quality and street network attributes. The research also finds that the visual components from the ConvPCA model achieves similar accuracy when compared to less interpretable dimension reduction techniques.},

Discrimination against black taxi riders resulted in far higher rates of trip cancellation and longer wait times compared with white riders. By contrast, ride-hailing dramatically reduced differences between riders. Findings suggest that discrimination occurs when people learn of rider characteristics and yield implications for how planners can use technology to deter discrimination.},

	abstract = {Urban transportation networks, from sidewalks and bicycle paths to streets and rail lines, provide the backbone for movement and socioeconomic life in cities. These networks can be understood as layers of a larger multiplex transport network. Because most cities are car-centric, the most developed layer is typically the street layer, while other layers can be highly disconnected. To make urban transport sustainable, cities are increasingly investing to develop their bicycle networks. However, given the usually patchy nature of the bicycle network layer, it is yet unclear how to extend it comprehensively and effectively given a limited budget. Here we develop data-driven, algorithmic network growth strategies and apply them to cities around the world, showing that small but focused investments allow to significantly increase the connectedness and directness of urban bicycle networks. We motivate the development of our algorithms with a network component analysis and with multimodal urban fingerprints that reveal different classes of cities depending on the connectedness between different network layers. We introduce two greedy algorithms to add the most critical missing links in the bicycle layer: The first algorithm connects the two largest connected components, the second algorithm connects the largest with the closest component. We show that these algorithms outmatch both a random approach and a baseline minimum investment strategy that connects the closest components ignoring size. Our computational approach outlines novel pathways from car-centric towards sustainable cities by taking advantage of urban data available on a city-wide scale. It is a first step towards a quantitative consolidation of bicycle infrastructure development that can become valuable for urban planners and stakeholders.},

It explores several themes: (i) GIScience and the informatics revolution; (ii) the lack of a community-owned innovation platform for GIScience research; (iii) the computational limitations imposed by desktop computing and the inability to scale up analysis; (iv) the continued failure to support the temporal dimension, and especially dynamic processes and models with feedbacks; (v) the challenge of embracing a wider and more heterogeneous view of geographical representation and analysis; and (vi) the urgent need to foster an active software development community to redress some of these shortcomings. A brief discussion then summarizes the issues and suggests that GIScience needs to work harder as a community to become more relevant to the broader geographic ﬁeld and meet a bigger set of representation, analysis, and modelling needs.},

In this study, we devised a methodology to design and optimize a road-based para-transit network using a genetic algorithm to optimize eﬃciency, robustness, and invulnerability. We ﬁrst generated stops following certain geospatial distributions and connected them to build networks of routes. From them, we selected an initial population to be optimized and applied the genetic algorithm. Overall, our modiﬁed genetic algorithm with 20 evolutions optimized the 20\% worst performing networks by 84\% on average. For one network, we were able to signiﬁcantly increase its ﬁtness score by 223\%. The highest ﬁtness score the algorithm was able to produce through optimization was 0.532 from a score of 0.303.},

Simultaneously, privately owned vehicles are vastly underused, wasting valuable opportunities for accommodating more people in a livable urban environment by occupying spacious parking areas. Since a data-driven quantification and visualization of such urban mobility space inequality is lacking, here we explore how crowdsourced data can help to advance its understanding. In particular, we describe how the open-source online platform What the Street!? uses massive user-generated data from OpenStreetMap for the interactive exploration of city-wide mobility spaces. Using polygon packing and graph algorithms, the platform rearranges all parking and mobility spaces of cars, rails, and bicycles of a city to be directly comparable, making mobility space inequality accessible to a broad public. This crowdsourced method confirms a prevalent imbalance between modal share and space allocation in 23 cities worldwide, typically discriminating bicycles. Analyzing the guesses of the platform’s visitors about mobility space distributions, we find that this discrimination is consistently underestimated in the public opinion. Finally, we discuss a visualized scenario in which extensive parking areas are regained through fleets of shared, autonomous vehicles. We outline how such accessible visualization platforms can facilitate urban planners and policy makers to reclaim road and parking space for pushing forward sustainable transport solutions.},

We show that time-critical optimization tasks, such as continuous redistribution of position data for cars in dense road networks, are suitable candidates for quantum computing.

	abstract = {A new generation of bike-sharing services is emerging in China. With this service, bikes can be unlocked and paid by using a smartphone and then picked up and left anywhere at users’ convenience. The unprecedented development of dockless bike-sharing services results in considerable socioeconomic and environmental benefits but also creates new urban issues. One of the most severe issues is users’ inappropriate parking behaviour. To solve this problem, electric fence (or geo-fence) policy and technology have been introduced in China to guide users to park bikes in designated zones. In this paper, we first propose a methodological framework to support electric fence planning for dockless bike-sharing services. We then apply our framework in a case study of Shanghai using a big dataset of bike trips. Results show that when the number of planned electric fences is 7,500, our electric fence plan can cover 91.8\% of total parking demand. In addition, our plan can ensure that at least 95.8\% of all bikes can be docked at one of planned electric fences and can help efficiently and accurately determine suitable locations for setting up planned electric fences.},

The main methodology is a newly developed agent-based model that incorporates empirical data about the mobility behavior of the citizens in order to calculate the traveled routes, the resulting trafﬁc and subsequent emissions. To assess the impact of different policies on CO2 emissions, different scenarios are simulated and their results are compared to a base line scenario. The model features a local and temporal resolution, effects like congestion and stop-and-go trafﬁc as well as commuters to and from other regions. In addition to the evaluation of certain policies (like a focus on electric cars, telecommuting or an improvement of the road infrastructure), a method is provided, that makes it possible to compare many diverse scenarios, featuring technological changes, societal changes or changes in the road network, all within the same framework. The ﬁndings suggest that one of the most promising strategies to decrease urban CO2 emissions is to focus on the use of electric cars, especially if it is combined with offering alternatives to private car trafﬁc and incentives for telecommuting. Banning the use of old cars only yields a signiﬁcant result if a large amount of cars is affected, which would make such a policy difﬁcult to implement. Expanding the road network has no signiﬁcant positive effect and may even encourage using cars, therefore leading to even more CO2 emissions. Due to its ﬂexible structure the presented model can be used to evaluate policies beyond what is presented in this study. It can easily be adapted to other conditions and geographical regions.},

In MCS, citizens actively participate in the sensing process by contributing data with their smartphones, tablets, wearables and other mobile devices to a collector. As citizens sustain costs while contributing data, i.e., the energy spent from the batteries for sensing and reporting, devising energy efﬁcient data collection frameworks (DCFs) is essential. In this work, we compare the energy efﬁciency of several DCFs through CrowdSenSim, which allows to perform largescale simulation experiments in realistic urban environments. Speciﬁcally, the DCFs under analysis differ one with each other by the data reporting mechanism implemented and the signaling between users and the collector needed for sensing and reporting decisions. Results reveal that the key criterion differentiating DCFs’ energy consumption is the data reporting mechanism. In principle, continuous reporting to the collector should be more energy consuming than probabilistic reporting. However, DCFs with continuous reporting that implement mechanisms to block sensing and data delivery after a certain amount of contribution are more effective in harvesting data from the crowd.},

	abstract = {Urban sprawl has been related to numerous negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Meanwhile, urban areas have been growing at alarming rates, urging for assessing sprawl towards sustainable development. However, sprawl is an elusive term and different approaches to measure it have lead to heterogeneous results. Moreover, most studies rely on private/commercial data-sets and their software is rarely made public, impeding research reproducibility and comparability. Furthermore, many works give as result a unique value for a region of analysis, dismissing local spatial diversity that is vital for urban planners and policy makers. We present in this paper an open source framework for assessing urban sprawl using open data. Locations of residential and activity units are used to measure mixed use development and built-up dispersion, whereas the street network is used to measure accessibility between different land uses. Sprawl patterns are identiﬁed, and the resulting spatial information allows focusing on particular neighborhoods for a ﬁne-grained analysis, as well as visualizing each sprawl dimension separately.},

Minimizing costs (i.e. distance, time, or money) associated with travel plays an important role in perceived and realized social quality of life. Identifying optimal interaction locations on road networks when there are multiple moving objects (MMO) with space–time constraints remains a challenge. In this research, we formalize the problem of ﬁnding dynamic ideal interaction locations for MMO as a spatial optimization model and introduce a context-based geoprocessing heuristic framework to address this problem. As a proof of concept, a case study involving identiﬁcation of a meetup location for multiple people under traﬃc conditions is used to validate the proposed geoprocessing framework. Five heuristic methods with regard to eﬃcient shortest-path search space have been tested. We ﬁnd that the R* tree-based algorithm performs the best with high quality solutions and low computation time. This framework is implemented in a geographic information systems environment to facilitate integration with external geographic contextual information, e.g. temporary road barriers, points of interest, and real-time traﬃc information, when dynamically searching for ideal meetup sites. The proposed method can be applied in trip planning, carpooling services, collaborative interaction, and logistics management.},

Previous studies have investigated the spatial interrelationship between street centralities and land use intensities using land cover data, thus neglecting the social functions of urban land. Taking the city of Shenzhen, China, as a case study, we used reclassiﬁed points of interest (POI) data to represent commercial, public service, and residential land, and then investigated the varying interrelationships between the street centralities and different types of urban land use intensities. We calculated three global centralities (“closeness”, “betweenness”, and “straightness”) as well as local centralities (1-km, 2-km, 3-km, and 5-km searching radiuses), which were transformed into raster frameworks using kernel density estimation (KDE) for correlation analysis. Global closeness and straightness are high in the urban core area, and roads with high global betweenness outline the skeleton of the street network. The spatial patterns of the local centralities are distinguished from the global centralities, reﬂecting local location advantages. High intensities of commercial and public service land are concentrated in the urban core, while residential land is relatively scattered. The bivariate correlation analysis implies that commercial and public service land are more dependent on centralities than residential land. Closeness and straightness have stronger abilities in measuring the location advantages than betweenness. The centralities and intensities are more positively correlated on a larger scale (census block). These ﬁndings of the spatial patterns and interrelationships of the centralities and intensities have major implications for urban land use and transportation planning.},

To address this problem, we propose a deep spatio-temporal residual neural network for road-network-based data modeling (DSTR-RNet). The proposed model constructs locally-connected neural network layers (LCNR) to model road network topology and integrates residual learning to model the spatio-temporal dependency. We test the DSTR-RNet by predicting the traﬃc ﬂow of Didi cab service, in an 8-km2 region with 2,616 road segments in Chengdu, China. The results demonstrate that the DSTR-RNet maintains the spatial precision and topology of the road network as well as improves the prediction accuracy. We discuss the prediction errors and compare the prediction results to those of grid-based CNN models. We also explore the sensitivity of the model to its parameters; this will aid the application of this model to network-based data modeling.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of exploring travel demand statistics to optimize ride-sharing routing, in which the driver of a vehicle determines a route to transport multiple customers with similar itineraries and schedules in a cost-effective and timely manner. This problem is important for unleashing economical and societal beneﬁts of ride-sharing. Meanwhile, it is challenging due to the need of (i) meeting travel delay requirements of customers, and (ii) making online decisions without knowing the exact travel demands beforehand. We present a general framework for exploring the new design space enabled by the demand-aware approach. We show that the demand-aware ride-sharing routing is fundamentally a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. We show that the problem is NP-Complete in the weak sense. We exploit the two-stage structure to design an optimal solution with pseudo-polynomial time complexity, which makes it amenable for practical implementation. We carry out extensive simulations based on real-world travel demand traces of Manhattan. The results show that using our demandaware solution instead of the conventional greedy-routing scheme increases the driver’s revenue by 10\%. The results further show that as compared to the case without ride-sharing, our ridesharing solution reduces the customers’ payment by 9\% and the total vehicle travel time (indicator of greenhouse gas emission) by 17\%. The driver can also get 26\% extra revenues per slot by participating in ride-sharing.},

	abstract = {The fact that accessibility shapes the geographic distribution of activity needs to be addressed in any long-term policy and planning for urban systems. One major problem is that current accessibility measures rely on the identification and quantification of attractions in the system. We propose that it is possible to devise a network centrality measure that bypasses this reliance and predicts the distribution of urban activity directly from the structure of the infrastructure networks over which interactions take place. From a basis of spatial interaction modelling and eigenvector centrality measures, we develop what we call a preferential centrality measure that recursively and self-consistently integrates activity, attraction and accessibility. Derived from the same logic as Google’s PageRank algorithm, we may describe its operation by drawing a parallel: Google’s PageRank algorithm ranks the importance of networked documents without the need to perform any analysis of their contents. Instead it considers the topological structure of the network and piggybacks thereby on contextualised and deep evaluation of documents by the myriad distributed agents that constructed the network. We do the same thing with regard to networked geographical zones. Our approach opens up new applications of modelling and promises to alleviate a host of recalcitrant problems, associated with integrated modelling, and the need for large volumes of socio-economic data. We present an initial validation of our proposed measure by using land taxation values in the Gothenburg municipality as an empirical proxy of urban activity. The resulting measure shows a promising correlation with the taxation values.},

In this work, we propose an operational planning model for mobility services operating in regions with AV-ready and not AV-ready zones. To this end, we model detailed automated driving areas and consider a heterogeneous ﬂeet comprised of three vehicle types: autonomous, conventional, and dualmode. While autonomous and conventional vehicles can only operate in their designated areas, dual-mode vehicles service zone-crossing demands in which both human and autonomous driving are required. For such a hybrid network, we introduce a new mathematical planning model based on a site-dependent variant of the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem (HDARP). With a numerical study for the city of Delft, The Netherlands, we provide insights into how operational costs, service levels, and ﬂeet utilization develop under 405 scenarios of multiple infrastructural settings and technology costs.},

Measures of walkable access can be grouped into two key types: permeability measures that quantify the ease of movement through an urban fabric, and catchment measures, quantifying the potential to reach destinations within walking distance. Of numerous street network measures in use, it has been shown that many are poor proxies of permeability and catchment. Instead, two new measures have been proposed: the area-weighted average perimeter (AwaP) and interface catchment (IC), that, combined, better capture the capacities of urban morphologies to enable and attract pedestrian movement. In this paper, we present the QGIS tool AwaP-IC, developed to overcome the diﬃculty of computing these measures. Unlike GIS tools based on models that abstract streets to axial lines, by employing new algorithms and spatial computation techniques, AwaP-IC analyses actual urban morphologies, based on cadastral maps delineating public and private land. This can empower a new stream of urban morphological studies with the computational power of GIS. As an open-source tool, it can be further developed for use in urban mapping and to streamline the analysis of large datasets.},

	abstract = {Background:  Understanding traffic is an important challenge in different scientific fields. While there are many approaches to constructing traffic models, most of them rely on origin–destination data and have difficulties when phenomena should be investigated that have an effect on the origin–destination matrix.
Methods:  A macroscopic traffic model is introduced that is novel in the sense that no origin–destination data are required as an input. This information is generated from mobility behavior data using a hybrid approach between agent-based modeling to find the origin and destination points of each vehicle and network techniques to find efficiently the routes most likely used to connect those points. The simulated road utilization and resulting congestion is compared to traffic data to quantitatively evaluate the results. Traffic jam avoidance behavior is included in the model in several variants, which are then all evaluated quantitatively.
Results:  The described model is applied to the City of Graz, a typical European city with about 320,000 inhabitants. Calculated results correspond well with reality.
Conclusions:  The introduced traffic model, which uses mobility data instead of origin–destination data as input, was successfully applied and offers unique advantages compared to traditional models: Mobility behavior data are valid for different systems, while origin–destination data are very specific to the region in question and more difficult to obtain. In addition, different scenarios (increased population, more use of public transport, etc.) can be evaluated and compared quickly.},

	abstract = {Identifying current and future informal regions within cities remains a crucial issue for policymakers and governments in developing countries. The delineation process of identifying such regions in cities requires a lot of resources. While there are various studies that identify informal settlements based on satellite image classification, relying on both supervised or unsupervised machine learning approaches, these models either require multiple input data to function or need further development with regards to precision. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for identifying and predicting informal settlements using only street intersections data, regardless of the variation of urban form, number of floors, materials used for construction or street width. With such minimal input data, we attempt to provide planners and policy-makers with a pragmatic tool that can aid in identifying informal zones in cities. The algorithm of the model is based on spatial statistics and a machine learning approach, using Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNL) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The proposed model relies on defining informal settlements based on two ubiquitous characteristics that these regions tend to be filled in with smaller subdivided lots of housing relative to the formal areas within the local context, and the paucity of services and infrastructure within the boundary of these settlements that require relatively bigger lots. We applied the model in five major cities in Egypt and India that have spatial structures in which informality is present. These cities are Greater Cairo, Alexandria, Hurghada and Minya in Egypt, and Mumbai in India. The predictSLUMS model shows high validity and accuracy for identifying and predicting informality within the same city the model was trained on or in different ones of a similar context.},

Results indicate that Beijing residents’ leisure activities primarily take place within walking distance from home and concentrate in the urban core and the district centers of the suburban area. Individuals tend to conduct daily leisure activities in neighborhoods that are close to parks and leisure attractions or with dense street intersections. Individuals that live with family members more actively engage in leisure activities, but individuals with a medium and high annual income conduct fewer leisure activities. Our analysis contributes to a better understanding of the spatial characteristics of leisure activities and how the sociodemographic and built environment characteristics inﬂuence residents’ leisure activities in the context of Chinese cities.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Smart Cities Network (ASCN) was initiated to develop a sustainable transport system in the ASEAN countries. A comprehensive understanding of street networks (SNs) can contribute signiﬁcantly to the achievement of this initiative. Therefore, this paper measured and compared characteristics of drivable street networks (DSNs) and walkable street networks (WSNs) of the 26 ASCN pilot cities by applying multiple network metrics. The OSMnx tool was used to download and analyse WSNs and DSNs from the OpenStreetMap. The ﬁndings present the topological and geometric characteristics of WSNs and DSNs that are diverse and characterized by diﬀerent factors. The cities with orthogonal street grids, high street density, intersection density, and fewer cul-de-sacs have good accessibility to reach destinations. In contrast, some other cities have more curvilinear and circuitous SNs with many missing links to other streets, which in turn are prone to traﬃc disruption. The study highlights the important features of SNs that have signiﬁcant implications for future designs of SNs in the ASCN whose goal is to make cities smart and liveable for ASEAN members.},

	abstract = {Objective: Lacking information about actual driving speed on most roads in the Minneapolis–St. Paul region, we determine car speeds using observations from a Global Positioning System (GPS)based travel survey. Speed of travel determines the likelihood and consequences of collisions. We identify the road segments where speeding occurs. This article then analyzes the relationship between link length, traveler characteristics, and speeding using GPS data collected from 152 individuals over a 7-day period as part of the Minneapolis–St. Paul Travel Behavior Inventory.
Methods: To investigate the relationship, we employed an algorithm and process to accurately match the GPS data with geographic information system (GIS) databases. Comparing actual travel speed from GPS data with posted speed limits, we measure where and when speeding occurs and by whom. We posit that link length and demographics shape the decision to speed.
Results: Speeding is widespread under both high speed limits (e.g., 60 mph [97 km/h]) and low speed limits (less than 25 mph [40 km/h]); in contrast, speeding is less common at 30–35 mph (48–56 km/h). The results suggest that driving patterns depend on the road type. We also find that when there are many intersections, the average link speed (and speeding) drops. Long links are conducive to speeding. Younger drivers and more educated drivers also speed more, and speeding occurs more often in the evening.
Conclusions: Road design and link length (or its converse, frequency of intersections) affect the likelihood of speeding. Use of increasingly available GPS data allows more systematic empirical analysis of designs and topologies that are conducive to road safety.},

Yet, city-wide road network traffic data are often hard to come by on a large scale over a longer period of time. We collect, describe, and analyze traffic data for 45 cities from HERE, a major online real-time traffic information provider. We sampled the online platform for city traffic data every 5 min during 1 year, in total more than 5 million samples covering more than 300 thousand road segments. Our aim is to describe some of the practical issues surrounding the data that we experienced in working with this type of data source, as well as to explore the data patterns and see how this data source provides information to study traffic in cities. We focus on data availability to characterize how traffic information is available for different cities; it measures the share of road segments with real-time traffic information at a given time for a given city. We describe the patterns of real-time data availability, and evaluate methods to handle filling in missing speed data for road segments when real-time information was not available. We conduct a validation case study based on Swedish traffic sensor data and point out challenges for future validation. Our findings include (i) a case study of validating the HERE data against ground truth available for roads and lanes in a Swedish city, showing that real-time traffic data tends to follow dips in travel speed but miss instantaneous higher speed measured in some sensors, typically at times when there are fewer vehicles on the road; (ii) using time series clustering, we identify four clusters of cities with different types of measurement patterns; and (iii) a k-nearest neighbor-based method consistently outperforms other methods to fill in missing real-time traffic speeds. We illustrate how to work with this kind of traffic data source that is increasingly available to researchers, travellers, and city planners. Future work is needed to broaden the scope of validation, and to apply these methods to use online data for improving our knowledge of traffic in cities.},

	abstract = {This research aims at investigating the direct and indirect influence of network structures on urban transportation performance with a macroscopic perspective. Transport systems are complex – the functional properties of a transportation network can affect mobility patterns which in turn changes the network performance. Understanding the topology of transportation networks is important in order to upgrade transport network design and to improve transportation performance. This paper attempts to determine important network indicators such connectivity, centrality and clustering measures for different network types (road, rail and bike) from 86 urban areas and 32 countries, based on comparable, directly observable open-source data such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the TomTom congestion database. Relations between indicators are identified through correlation measures. In addition, regression models are calibrated which quantify the relations between infrastructure accessibility (IA) and network indicators and average traffic delay times. The indicator average road connectivity over average road circuity (RCRC), which is proposed in this study, has not been cited before in literature. The main results suggest that the determination of distance-based connectivity of networks is an important proxy to understand road transportation performance. Consequently, two main results were obtained: (1) an increase in average short-distance connectivity of road networks (average closeness centrality and RCRC) eases road congestion, presumably because the network distributes road traffic more homogenously while decreasing low-permeability choke points, (2) an increase of the average short-distance connectivity of networks of alternative modes such as rail or bike (average weighted rail clustering coefficient and average cycle closeness centrality) does alleviate road congestion. In particular, for cities with over 0.4 km per km2 cycleway density, an increase in cycleway closeness centrality decreases road congestion and it does so almost as efficiently as an increase in road infrastructure accessibility. Presumably, well-connected, alternative networks with short and direct routes convince car users to shift to the alternative mode, which decreases road traffic volumes.},

Most academic papers on the topic have, so far, been concentrated in Europe and America, with less attention paid to rapidly growing cities in low income nations. This is problematic because transportation networks are rapidly evolving in developing countries and the impacts of misguided transportation policies (including air pollution and road traffic casualties) are particularly acute. Metrics on the performance of street networks could help inform policy. This paper uses the Python package OSMnx to analyze and evaluate street networks in 12 districts of Phnom Penh from OpenStreetMap. Results suggest that topological and geometric characteristics of street networks are more conducive to walking and biking in the central districts than in the peripheral districts. The central districts are also better connected to core network corridors. To promote sustainable urban mobility, new developments and street renewals should be incorporated facilities, services, and safety of walking and biking. Some policy implications are suggested for future designs of the Phnom Penh’s street networks to increase livability and sustainability.},

	abstract = {The prosperity of ride-sharing services has rippled in the communities of GIScience, transportation, and urban planning. Meanwhile, road network structure has been analyzed from a network science perspective that focuses on nodes and relational links and aims to predictive models. However, limited empirical studies have explored the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility through such perspective. This paper utilizes the spatial Durbin model to understand the relationship between road network structure and ridesharing accessibility, proxied by Uber accessibility, through classical network measures of degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Taking the city of Atlanta as a case study, we have found in addition to population density and road network density, larger values of degree centrality and smaller values of closeness centrality of the road network are associated with better accessibility of Uber services. However, the eﬀects of betweenness centrality are not signiﬁcant. Furthermore, we have revealed heterogeneous eﬀects of degree centrality and closeness centrality on the accessibility of Uber services, as the magnitudes of their eﬀects vary by diﬀerent time windows (i.e., weekday vs. weekend, rush hour in the morning vs. evening). Network science provides us both conceptual and methodological measures to understand the association between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility. In this study, we constructed road network structure measures with OpenStreetMap, which is reproducible, replicable, and scalable because of its global coverage and public availability. The study resonates with the notion of cities as the set of interactions across networks, as we have observed time-sensitive heterogeneous eﬀects of road network structure on ride-sharing accessibility.},

The proposed methods are applied to generate the bike catchment areas of the metro stations in Shanghai as a case study. We then conduct analyses to answer our research questions in three aspects. First, we analyze the spatial distribution patterns of the bike catchment areas and determine that the sizes of bike catchment areas increase from the city center to the suburban area. Second, using two indicators, namely coverage ratio and overlap degree, we examine the impact of dockless bike sharing on the catchment areas as compared with 800 m pedestrian catchment areas. As a resut, the catchment coverage ratio of the central city is increased by 104\% and the maximum overlap degree increases from five to nine stations. Third, we apply regression models to explore the factors associated with the sizes of the bike catchment areas. The results show that the sizes of the bike catchment areas are positively associated with good metro service, frequent morning trips, diverse users, and large distances to the city center and terminal stations, but negatively associated with the density of metro stations.

Moreover, the decline in labor market fluidity seems unlikely to have been caused by an improvement in worker-firm matching, the formalization of hiring practices, or an increase in land use regulation or other regulations. Plausible avenues for further exploration include changes in the worker-firm relationship, particularly with regard to compensation adjustment; changes in firm characteristics such as firm size and age; and a decline in social trust, which may have increased the cost of job search or made both parties in the hiring process more risk averse.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}small{\textgreater}(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.){\textless}/small{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {An argument that operational urban planning can be improved by the application of the tools of urban economics to the design of regulations and infrastructure.Urban planning is a craft learned through practice. Planners make rapid decisions that have an immediate impact on the ground―the width of streets, the minimum size of land parcels, the heights of buildings. The language they use to describe their objectives is qualitative―“sustainable,” “livable,” “resilient”―often with no link to measurable outcomes. Urban economics, on the other hand, is a quantitative science, based on theories, models, and empirical evidence largely developed in academic settings. In this book, the eminent urban planner Alain Bertaud argues that applying the theories of urban economics to the practice of urban planning would greatly improve both the productivity of cities and the welfare of urban citizens.Bertaud explains that markets provide the indispensable mechanism for cities' development. He cites the experience of cities without markets for land or labor in pre-reform China and Russia; this “urban planners' dream” created inefficiencies and waste. Drawing on five decades of urban planning experience in forty cities around the world, Bertaud links cities' productivity to the size of their labor markets; argues that the design of infrastructure and markets can complement each other; examines the spatial distribution of land prices and densities; stresses the importance of mobility and affordability; and critiques the land use regulations in a number of cities that aim at redesigning existing cities instead of just trying to alleviate clear negative externalities. Bertaud concludes by describing the new role that joint teams of urban planners and economists could play to improve the way cities are managed.},

	abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has become a popular paradigm for data collection in urban environments. In MCS systems, a crowd supplies sensing information for monitoring phenomena through mobile devices. Typically, a large number of participants is required to make a sensing campaign successful. For such a reason, it is often not practical for researchers to build and deploy large testbeds to assess the performance of frameworks and algorithms for data collection, user recruitment, and evaluating the quality of information. Simulations offer a valid alternative. In this paper, we present CrowdSenSim 2.0, a significant extension of the popular CrowdSenSim simulation platform. CrowdSenSim 2.0 features a stateful approach to support algorithms where the chronological order of events matters, extensions of the architectural modules, including an additional system to model urban environments, code refactoring, and parallel execution of algorithms. All these improvements boost the performances of the simulator and make the runtime execution and memory utilization significantly lower, also enabling the support for larger simulation scenarios. We demonstrate retrocompatibility with the older platform and evaluate as a case study a stateful data collection algorithm.},

When we examine the correlation between road network density and traﬃc ﬂow characteristics including the travel time and speed of 35 major cities in China, no correlation exists between them which may result from diﬀerent network structures, dynamic traﬃc demands, traﬃc control plans, driving behaviors, and so on. It inspires us to explore the correlation between road network density and static travel indicators. Then structural characteristic of road networks can be treated as a ﬁxed relatively attribute and becomes the next research emphasis of this work. Comparative analysis results of three current cities (Xiamen, Washington D.C., San Jose) indicate that the average travel distance in diﬀerent cities with the similar land area will not increase signiﬁcantly as road network density increases. Results of an analysis of road network evolution of Changchun, China show that the increase of road network density shortens the average road segment length as well as travel distance in general. This impact on average travel distance is also related to evolution periods or modes of urban road networks. These ﬁndings provide important empirical support for planners and policymakers to understand the impacts of road network density on transport performance and design more eﬀective urban road networks.},

The problem arises when a wireless mobile entity is required to communicate with wireless nodes deployed apart from each other with a distance greater than their communication range and the mobility is limited with the transportation network layout. The goal is constructing a route which minimizes the mobility cost. Travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic discrete optimization problem to identify optimal routes between particular cities. Unlike TSP, our problem deﬁnes a neighborhood based on the node location and wireless communication range and seeks the optimal path between the neighborhoods. This paper deﬁnes mobility cost in terms of distance and delay separately. However, based on the deﬁned cost function, the solution is applicable to other metrics as well including energy consumption.},

Here we develop a data-driven, network-based method to quantify the liveability of a city. We introduce a life quality index (LQI) based on pedestrian accessibility to amenities and services, safety and environmental variables. Our computational approach outlines novel ways to measure life quality in a more granular scale, that can become valuable for urban planners, city oﬃcials and stakeholders.

The proposed extension significantly outperforms traditional methods, which build on the assumption of travel according to the rectilinear distance metric. While only marginally increasing the data collection effort, the proposed extension yields reductions of 26 percent points in mean absolute percentage error compared to traditional approximation methods. The obtained distance estimates are within 5\%-15\% of near-optimal solutions obtained with a large neighborhood search heuristic, depending on the circuity of the region and the density of stops. Further, by providing a real-world validation of CA methods, we explore how novel sources of geo-spatial and traffic-related data can be efficiently leveraged to improve the predictive performance of CA methods. The proposed extension is particularly relevant to increase the real-world validity of CA methods applied to large-scale optimization problems in logistics system design and planning within urban areas.},

Rather than taking an approach based on machine learning, which generally leads to models that cannot be understood by humans or related to domain theory, the approach described here suggests we can instead construct models from fragments of domain understanding—such as commonly encountered equation forms, known constants and laws—resulting in discovered models that can both be understood by humans and directly compared with known theory. We then propose a conceptual model of the discovery process by which the various stages and components of discovery and explanation work together to learn models from data. The approach described weaves together ideas for describing models from Harvey’s book ‘Explanation in Geography’ with current thinking on how explanatory models might be ‘discovered’ from data from Inductive Process modeling. On the way, we also highlight: (i) why it is important to have models that explain as well as predict, (ii) how such an approach contrasts with – and goes beyond – current work in deep learning, (iii) how the task of model discovery might be tackled computationally and (iv) how computational model discovery can play a valuable role in creating geographical explanations.},

Our model considers the intrinsic graph structure as well as the extrinsic information to gain a more comprehensive and holistic view of the summarization task.

Fortunately , the increased data available about urban systems opens the possibility of constructing a quantitative ‘science of cities’, with the aim of identifying and modelling essential phenomena. Statistical physics plays a major role in this effort by bringing tools and concepts able to bridge theory and empirical results. This Perspective illustrates this point by focusing on fundamental objects in cities: the distribution of the urban population; segregation phenomena and spin-like models; the polycentric transition of the activity organization; energy considerations about mobility and models inspired by gravity and radiation concepts; CO2 emitted by transport; and finally , scaling that describes how various socio-economical and infrastructures evolve when cities grow.},

	abstract = {Reproducible quantitative research is research that has been documented sufficiently rigorously that a third party can replicate any quantitative results that arise. It is argued here that such a goal is desirable for quantitative human geography, particularly as trends in this area suggest a turn towards the creation of algorithms and codes for simulation and the analysis of Big Data. A number of examples of good practice in this area are considered, spanning a time period from the late 1970s to the present day. Following this, practical aspects such as tools that enable research to be made reproducible are discussed, and some beneficial side effects of adopting the practice are identified. The paper concludes by considering some of the challenges faced by quantitative geographers aspiring to publish reproducible research.},

	abstract = {One of the oldest questions of spatial planning is about the profession itself. Because of the direct fields of application on the urban or regional scale, or on sectorial fields like transport or environmental planning, scholars in planning sciences always quarreled with themselves whether their approaches can be seen as discipline itself. Regardless of the different answers and outcomes of this question, it becomes clear that the debate triggers more than just the acceptance as a discipline. One might think that the scientific nature of spatial planning and thus the raison d’être of planning sciences are under general suspicion. This requires a deeper discussion about the definition of sciences and the demarcation problem as discussed in classical (Popper, Kuhn) and more contemporary approaches (Hoyningen-Huene, Park) in the philosophy of science, and what this means for the discussion about spatial planning as a science as well as a discipline. Therefore, various conclusions to regard planning sciences not as one discipline but as multiple disciplines are possible. In this sense, let us dig deep toward the bottom line of the debate.},

	abstract = {Disconnected urban street networks, which we call “street-network sprawl,” are strongly associated with increased vehicle travel, energy use and CO2 emissions, as shown by previous research in Europe and North America. In this paper, we provide the first systematic and globally commensurable measures of street-network sprawl based on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts. Using data on all 46 million km of mapped streets worldwide, we compute these measures for the entire Earth at the highest possible resolution. We generate a summary scalar measure for street-network sprawl, the Street-Network Disconnectedness index (SNDi), as well as a data-driven multidimensional classification that identifies eight empirical street-network types that span the spectrum of connectivity, from gridiron to dendritic (tree-like) and circuitous networks. Our qualitative validation shows that both the scalar and multidimensional measures are meaningfully comparable within and across countries, and successfully capture varied dimensions of walkability and urban development. We further show that in select high-income countries, our measures explain crosssectional variation in household transportation decisions, and a one standard-deviation increase in SNDi is associated with an extra 0.25 standard deviations in cars owned per household. We aggregate our measures to the scale of countries, cities, and smaller geographies and describe patterns in street-network sprawl around the world. Latin America, Japan, South Korea, much of Europe, and North Africa stand out for their low levels of street-network sprawl, while the highest levels are found in south-east Asia, the United States, and the British Isles. Our calculations provide the foundation for future work to understand urban processes, predict future pathways of transportation energy consumption and emissions, and identify effective policy responses.},

Types include social neighborhoods, architectural villages, environments supporting diversity, designed enclaves, ecoburbs, ecocities, and developments emphasizing the role of technology. The classiﬁcation is based on the developments’ key assumptions and intellectual histories, and particularly their social, ecological, economic, political, and aesthetic character. It is a classiﬁcation not of the physical forms of such planned communities but of their underlying design, planning, and development ideas. For each type, the paper outlines important subtypes and proposes some key dilemmas in its future evolution.

	abstract = {Background: Cycling and other forms of active transportation provide health benefits via increased physical activity. However, direct evidence of the extent to which these benefits may be offset by exposure and intake of traffic-related air pollution is limited. The purpose of this study is to measure changes in endothelial function, measures of oxidative stress and inflammation, and lung function in healthy participants before and after cycling along a high- and low- traffic route.
Methods: Participants (n = 38) bicycled for 1 h along a Downtown and a Residential designated bicycle route in a randomized crossover trial. Heart rate, power output, particulate matter air pollution (PM10, PM2.5, and PM1) and particle number concentration (PNC) were measured. Lung function, endothelial function (reactive hyperemia index, RHI), C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine were assessed within one hour pre- and post-trial.
Results: Geometric mean PNC exposures and intakes were higher along the Downtown (exposure = 16,226 particles/cm3; intake = 4.54 × 1010 particles) compared to the Residential route (exposure = 9367 particles/cm3; intake = 3.13 × 1010 particles). RHI decreased following cycling along the Downtown route and increased on the Residential route; in mixed linear regression models, the (post-pre) change in RHI was 21\% lower following cycling on the Downtown versus the Residential route (−0.43, 95\% CI: -0.79, −0.079) but RHI decreases were not associated with measured exposure or intake of air pollutants. The differences in RHI by route were larger amongst females and older participants. No consistent associations were observed for any of the other outcome measures.
Conclusions: Although PNC exposures and intakes were higher along the Downtown route, the lack of association between air pollutant exposure or intake with RHI and other measures suggests other exposures related to cycling on the Downtown route may have been influential in the observed differences between routes in RHI.

	abstract = {Background: Researchers and policymakers are increasingly focused on combined exposures to social and environmental stressors, especially given how often these stressors tend to co-locate. Such exposures are equally relevant in urban and rural areas and may accrue disproportionately to particular communities or speciﬁc subpopulations.
Objectives: To estimate relationships between racial isolation (RI), a measure of the extent to which minority racial/ethnic group members are exposed to only one another, and long-term particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of b 2.5 μ (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) levels in urban and nonurban areas of the eastern two-thirds of the US.
Methods: Long-term (5 year average) census tract-level PM2.5 and O3 concentrations were calculated using output from a downscaler model (2002–2006). The downscaler uses a linear regression with additive and multiplicative bias coefﬁcients to relate ambient monitoring data with gridded output from the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. A local, spatial measure of RI was calculated at the tract level, and tracts were classiﬁed by urbanicity, RI, and geographic region. We examined differences in estimated pollutant exposures by RI, urbanicity, and demographic subgroup (e.g., race/ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, age), and used linear models to estimate associations between RI and air pollution levels in urban, suburban, and rural tracts.
Results: High RI tracts (≥80th percentile) had higher average PM2.5 levels in each category of urbanicity compared to low RI tracts (b20th percentile), with the exception of the rural West. Patterns in O3 levels by urbanicity and RI differed by region. Linear models indicated that PM2.5 concentrations were signiﬁcantly and positively associated with RI. The largest association between PM2.5 and RI was observed in the rural Midwest, where a one quintile increase in RI was associated with a 0.90 μg/m3 (95\% conﬁdence interval: 0.83, 0.99 μg/m3) increase in PM2.5 concentration. Associations between O3 and RI in the Northeast, Midwest and West were positive and highest in suburban and rural tracts, even after controlling for potential confounders such as percentage in poverty.
Conclusion: RI is associated with higher 5 year estimated PM2.5 concentrations in urban, suburban, and rural census tracts, adding to evidence that segregation is broadly associated with disparate air pollution exposures. Disproportionate burdens to adverse exposures such as air pollution may be a pathway to racial/ethnic disparities in health.},

Objectives: We investigated whether exposures to PM2.5 components differ by race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status (SES).
Methods: Long-term exposures (2000 through 2006) were estimated for 215 U.S. census tracts for PM2.5 and for 14 PM2.5 components. Population-weighted exposures were combined to generate overall estimated exposures by race/ethnicity, education, poverty status, employment, age, and earnings. We compared population characteristics for tracts with and without PM2.5 component monitors.
Results: Larger disparities in estimated exposures were observed for components than for PM2.5 total mass. For race/ethnicity, whites generally had the lowest exposures. Non-Hispanic blacks had higher exposures than did whites for 13 of the 14 components. Hispanics generally had the highest exposures (e.g., 152\% higher than whites for chlorine, 94\% higher for aluminum). Young persons (0–19 years of age) had levels as high as or higher than other ages for all exposures except sulfate. Persons with lower SES had higher estimated exposures, with some exceptions. For example, a 10\% increase in the proportion unemployed was associated with a 20.0\% increase in vanadium and an 18.3\% increase in elemental carbon. Census tracts with monitors had more non-Hispanic blacks, lower education and earnings, and higher unemployment and poverty than did tracts without monitors.
Conclusions: Exposures to PM2.5 components differed by race/ethnicity, age, and SES. If some components are more toxic than others, certain populations are likely to suffer higher health burdens. Demographics differed between populations covered and not covered by monitors.},

To quantify nationwide disparities in the location of particulate matter emitting PM is not a direct measure of ex(PM)-emitting facilities by the characteristics of the surrounding residential population and to illustrate various spatial scales at which to consider such disparities.
Methods. We assigned facilities emitting PM in the 2011 National Emissions Inventory to nearby block groups across the 2009 to 2013 American Community Survey population. We calculated the burden from these emissions for racial/ethnic groups and by poverty status. We quantiﬁed disparities nationally and for each state and county in the country.
Results. For PM of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or less, those in poverty had 1.35 times higher burden than did the overall population, and non-Whites had 1.28 times higher burden.

	abstract = {This study was performed to investigate the concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 inside trains and platforms on subway lines 1, 2, 4 and 5 in Seoul, KOREA. PM10, PM2.5, carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were monitored using real-time monitoring instruments in the afternoons (between 13:00 and 16:00). The concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 inside trains were significantly higher than those measured on platforms and in ambient air reported by the Korea Ministry of Environment (Korea MOE). This study found that PM10 levels inside subway lines 1, 2 and 4 exceeded the Korea indoor air quality (Korea IAQ) standard of 150 μg/m3. The average percentage that exceeded the PM10 standard was 83.3\% on line 1, 37.9\% on line 2 and 63.1\% on line 4, respectively. PM2.5 concentration ranged from 77.7 μg/m3 to 158.2 μg/m3, which were found to be much higher than the ambient air PM2.5 standard promulgated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) (24 h arithmetic mean: 65 μg/m3). The reason for interior PM10 and PM2.5 being higher than those on platforms is due to subway trains in Korea not having mechanical ventilation systems to supply fresh air inside the train. This assumption was supported by the CO2 concentration results monitored in tube of subway that ranged from 1153 ppm to 3377 ppm. The percentage of PM2.5 in PM10 was 86.2\% on platforms, 81.7\% inside trains, 80.2\% underground and 90.2\% at ground track. These results indicated that fine particles (PM2.5) accounted for most of PM10 and polluted subway air. GLM statistical analysis indicated that two factors related to monitoring locations (underground and ground or inside trains and on platforms) significantly influence PM10 (p b 0.001, R2 = 0.230) and PM2.5 concentrations (p b 0.001, R2 = 0.172). Correlation analysis indicated that PM10, PM2.5, CO2 and CO were significantly correlated at p b 0.01 although correlation coefficients were different. The highest coefficient was 0.884 for the relationship between PM10 and PM2.5.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12940-019-0544-9},
	abstract = {Background: Cohort studies have documented associations between fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and mortality risk. However, there remains uncertainty regarding the contribution of co-pollutants and the stability of pollution-mortality associations in models that include multiple air pollutants. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the PM2.5-mortality relationship varies spatially, when exposures are decomposed according to scale of spatial variability, or temporally, when effect estimates are allowed to change between years.
Methods: A cohort of 635,539 individuals was compiled using public National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 1987 to 2014 and linked with mortality follow-up through 2015. Modelled air pollution exposure estimates for PM2.5, other criteria air pollutants, and spatial decompositions ({\textless} 1 km, 1–10 km, 10–100 km, {\textgreater} 100 km) of PM2.5 were assigned at the census-tract level. The NHIS samples were also divided into yearly cohorts for temporallydecomposed analyses. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) in regression models that included up to six criteria pollutants; four spatial decompositions of PM2.5; and two- and five-year lagged mean PM2.5 exposures in the temporally-decomposed cohorts. Meta-analytic fixed-effect estimates were calculated using results from temporally-decomposed analyses and compared with time-independent results using 17- and 28-year exposure windows.
Results: In multiple-pollutant analyses, PM2.5 demonstrated the most robust pollutant-mortality association. Coarse fraction particulate matter (PM2.5–10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were also associated with excess mortality risk. The PM2.5-mortality association was observed across all four spatial scales of PM2.5, with higher but less precisely estimated HRs observed for local ({\textless} 1 km) and neighborhood (1–10 km) variations. In temporally-decomposed analyses, the PM2.5-mortality HRs were stable across yearly cohorts. The meta-analytic HR using two-year lagged PM2.5 equaled 1.10 (95\% CI 1.07, 1.13) per 10 μg/m3. Comparable results were observed in time-independent analyses using a 17-year (HR 1.13, CI 1.09, 1.16) or 28-year (HR 1.09, CI 1.07, 1.12) exposure window.
Conclusions: Long-term exposures to PM2.5, PM2.5–10, and SO2 were associated with increased risk of all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each spatial decomposition of PM2.5 was associated with mortality risk, and PM2.5mortality associations were consistent over time.},

Objective: We describe whether the health benefits from the increased physical activity of a modal shift for urban commutes outweigh the health risks. Data sources and extraction: We have summarized the literature for air pollution, traffic accidents, and physical activity using systematic reviews supplemented with recent key studies. Data synthesis: We quantified the impact on all-cause mortality when 500,000 people would make a transition from car to bicycle for short trips on a daily basis in the Netherlands. We have expressed mortality impacts in life-years gained or lost, using life table calculations. For individuals who shift from car to bicycle, we estimated that beneficial effects of increased physical activity are substantially larger (3–14 months gained) than the potential mortality effect of increased inhaled air pollution doses (0.8–40 days lost) and the increase in traffic accidents (5–9 days lost). Societal benefits are even larger because of a modest reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and traffic accidents.
Conclusions: On average, the estimated health benefits of cycling were substantially larger than the risks relative to car driving for individuals shifting their mode of transport.},

Principal component analyses revealed that tract Latinx composition was highly correlated with extrinsic vulnerability (economic disadvantage and limited English-speaking ability), and that tract Black composition was highly correlated with intrinsic vulnerability (elevated prevalence of asthma-related emergency department visits and low birth weight). Spatial lag regression models tested hypotheses regarding the association between Asian, Black, and Latinx population vulnerability factors and the 2009–2011 annual average PM2.5 percentile rankings, net of emissions and spatial covariates. Results indicated that the percent Latinx population, followed by the regional clustering of PM2.5, and the percent of non-Latinx Black and non-Latinx Asian population were the strongest positive multivariable correlates of PM2.5 percentile rankings, net of other factors. Additional analyses suggested that despite shifting demographic and spatial correlates of 2012–2014 PM2.5 exposures, the tracts’ Black and Latinx composition and location in the San Joaquin Valley remain important vulnerability factors with implications for future research and policy.},

	abstract = {Background: Prenatal and early life air pollution exposure may impair healthy neurodevelopment, increasing risk of childhood behavioral disorders, but epidemiological evidence is inconsistent. Little is known about factors that determine susceptibility.
Methods: Participants were mother-child dyads from the CANDLE study, an ECHO PATHWAYS Consortium birth cohort set in the mid-South United States, who completed a preschool visit. We estimated prenatal and childhood exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10) at participants’ residences using a national annual average universal kriging model (land-use regression with spatial smoothing). Distance to nearest major roadway was used as a proxy for traffic-related pollution. Primary outcomes were children’s internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Regression models adjusted for individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic measures, maternal IQ, and multiple other potential confounders. We tested for effect modification by select maternal and child characteristics.
Results: The analytic sample (N=975 of 1503 enrolled) was 64\% African American and 53\% had a household annual income below \$35,000; child mean age was 4.3 years (SD: 0.4). Mean prenatal NO2 and PM10 exposures were 12.0 ppb (SD: 2.4) and 20.8 µg/m3 (SD: 2.0); postnatal exposures were lower. In fully adjusted models, 2 ppb higher prenatal NO2 was positively associated with externalizing behavior (6\%; 95\% CI: 1, 11\%); for postnatal NO2 exposure, associations were stronger (8\%; 95\%CI: 0, 16\%). Prenatal NO2 exposure was also associated with an increased odds of clinically significant internalizing and externalizing behaviors. We found suggestive evidence that socioeconomic adversity and African American race increases susceptibility. PM10 and road proximity were not associated with outcomes.
Conclusions: Findings showed that air pollution exposure is positively associated with child behavior problems and that boys and low SES children may be more susceptible; importantly, associations were observed at exposures below current air quality standards.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Studies suggest exposure to ambient particulate matter less than 2.5 mg/m3 in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) may be associated with preterm birth (PTB), but few have evaluated how this is modiﬁed by ambient temperature. We investigated the relationship between PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and PTB in infants without birth defects (1999e2006) and enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and how it is modiﬁed by concurrent temperature.
Methods: PTB was deﬁned as spontaneous or iatrogenic delivery before 37 weeks. Exposure was assigned using inverse distance weighting with up to four monitors within 50 kilometers of maternal residence. To account for state-level variations, a Bayesian two-level hierarchal model was developed.
Results: PTB was associated with PM2.5 during the third and fourth months of pregnancy (range: (odds ratio (95\% conﬁdence interval) ¼ 1.00 (0.35, 2.15) to 1.49 (0.82, 2.68) and 1.31 (0.56, 2.91) to 1.62 (0.7, 3.32), respectively); no week of exposure conveyed greater risk. Temperature may modify this relationship; higher local average temperatures during pregnancy yielded stronger positive relationships between PM2.5 and PTB compared to nonstratiﬁed results.
Conclusions: Results add to literature on associations between PM2.5 and PTB, underscoring the importance of considering co-exposures when estimating effects of PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Expanding the theoretical principles of power, proximity, and physiology, we hypothesize that the harmful effect of ﬁne particulate matter on life expectancy is greater in states with higher levels of income inequality and larger black populations. To test our hypothesis, we use two-way ﬁxed effects regression analysis to estimate the effect of a three-way interaction between ﬁne particulate matter, income share of the top ten percent, and the percent of the population that is black on state-level average life expectancy for all US states and the District of Columbia (2000–2014). The ﬁndings support our hypothesis: the estimated effect of the three-way interaction on average life expectancy is negative and statistically signiﬁcant, net of various socioeconomic and demographic controls. Using post-estimation techniques, we visually illustrate that the harmful effect of ﬁne particulate matter on life expectancy is especially pronounced in states with both very high levels of income inequality and very large black populations. We conclude by summarizing the theoretical and substantive implications of our ﬁndings, the limitations of the study, and potential next steps in this evolving area of interdisciplinary research.},

	abstract = {This study examines the persistent impacts of historical racebased discriminatory housing policies on contemporary urban environments in the United States. Speciﬁcally, we examine the relationships between Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) grades assigned to neighborhoods in the 1930s and the current distribution of tree canopy and level of exposure to air pollution hazards. Our results indicate a clear gradient in tree canopy by HOLC grade, with better neighborhood grades associated with signiﬁcantly higher percentage of tree canopy coverage. The pattern also exists for airborne carcinogens and respiratory hazards, with worse neighborhood grades associated with signiﬁcantly higher hazards exposure. Our ﬁndings indicate that early 20th century discriminatory housing policies exert a contemporary inﬂuence on patterns of green space exposure in American cities, with implications for health and health inequities. Our ﬁndings suggest that, in order to achieve equitable access to the beneﬁts of urban greenspace, we must acknowledge these historical inﬂuences and consider policies and practices that directly counter these inﬂuences, for example, through targeted greenspace development in areas historically identiﬁed as unﬁt for investment.},

To assess the effect of these regulations, daily-resolved vehicular source contributions from 2002 to 2006 were pooled together and compared to the combination of 2008 to 2012 datasets. Compared to the 2002 e2006 dataset, the median values of vehicular emissions in 2008e2012 statistically signiﬁcantly decreased by 24 and 21\% in LA and Rubidoux, respectively.

	abstract = {Mechanistic air pollution modeling is essential in air quality management, yet the extensive expertise and computational resources required to run most models prevent their use in many situations where their results would be useful. Here, we present InMAP (Intervention Model for Air Pollution), which offers an alternative to comprehensive air quality models for estimating the air pollution health impacts of emission reductions and other potential interventions. InMAP estimates annual-average changes in primary and secondary fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations—the air pollution outcome generally causing the largest monetized health damages–attributable to annual changes in precursor emissions. InMAP leverages pre-processed physical and chemical information from the output of a state-of-the-science chemical transport model and a variable spatial resolution computational grid to perform simulations that are several orders of magnitude less computationally intensive than comprehensive model simulations. In comparisons run here, InMAP recreates comprehensive model predictions of changes in total PM2.5 concentrations with population-weighted mean fractional bias (MFB) of −17\% and population-weighted R2 = 0.90. Although InMAP is not specifically designed to reproduce total observed concentrations, it is able to do so within published air quality model performance criteria for total PM2.5. Potential uses of InMAP include studying exposure, health, and environmental justice impacts of potential shifts in emissions for annual-average PM2.5. InMAP can be trained to run for any spatial and temporal domain given the availability of appropriate simulation output from a comprehensive model.

After assaying the concepts that have guided most of the research, the paper considers the arguments that analysts have offered for the causes of environmental injustice. The review of the literature reveals signiﬁcant problems of focus, measurement, speciﬁcation and research design. Nonetheless, environmental justice research raises critical concerns about how citizens should be treated and what constitutes a just distribution of collective urban goods in a democratic society.

	abstract = {Numerous mountain valleys experience wintertime particulate pollution events, when persistent cold air pools (PCAPs) develop and inhibit atmospheric mixing, leading to the accumulation of pollutants. Here we examine the relationships between trace gases and criteria pollutants during winter in Utah’s Salt Lake Valley, in an effort to better understand the roles of transport versus chemical processes during differing meteorological conditions as well as insights into how targeted reductions in greenhouse gases will impact local air quality in varying meteorological conditions. CO2 is a chemically inert gas that is coemitted during fossil fuel combustion with pollutants. Many of these coemitted pollutants are precursors that react chemically to form secondary particulate matter. Thus, CO2 can serve as a stable tracer and potentially help distinguish transport versus chemical inﬂuences on pollutants. During the winter of 2015–2016, we isolated enhancements in CO2 over baseline levels due to urban emissions (“CO2ex”). CO2ex was paired with similar excesses in other pollutant concentrations. These relationships were examined during different wintertime conditions and stages of pollution episodes: (a) Non-PCAP, (b) beginning, and (c) latter stages of an episode. We found that CO2ex is a good indicator of the presence of gaseous criteria pollutants and a reasonable indicator of PM2.5. Additionally, the relationships between CO2ex and criteria pollutants differ during different phases of PCAP events which provide insight into meteorological and transport processes. Lastly, we found a slight overestimation of CO:CO2 emission ratios and a considerable overestimation of NOx:CO2 by existing inventories for the Salt Lake Valley.},

Effective and low cost strategies to solve these problems have been discussed by a number of researchers. Previous studies typically evaluated near-term and direct co-benefits, neglecting the socio-economic impacts on CO2 and PM2.5 emission. In this paper, productionbased and consumption-based emissions are quantified to compare the differences. Input-output analysis (IOA) is adopted to investigate the consumption-based CO2 and PM2.5 emissions that result from the current monetary flows and energy structure. The correlations of CO2 and PM2.5 emissions from both consumptionbased and production-based perspectives are assessed to see the extent to which these co-benefits are valued in integrated assessment models. We distribute the indirect emissions to original sector and identify the correlations of CO2 reductions for air quality in Beijing, which provide a new point of view on formulating impartial and effective polices of alleviating the air pollution and reducing CO2 emissions.},

To understand their large-scale structure, it is important to develop methods that allow one to directly probe the effects of space on structure and dynamics. Historically, algebraic topology has provided one framework for rigorously and quantitatively describing the global structure of a space, and recent advances in topological data analysis (TDA) have given scholars a new lens for analyzing network data. In this paper, we study a variety of spatial networks --- including both synthetic and natural ones --- using novel topological methods that we recently developed specifically for analyzing spatial networks. We demonstrate that our methods are able to capture meaningful quantities, with specifics that depend on context, in spatial networks and thereby provide useful insights into the structure of those networks, including a novel approach for characterizing them based on their topological structures. We illustrate these ideas with examples of synthetic networks and dynamics on them, street networks in cities, snowflakes, and webs spun by spiders under the influence of various psychotropic substances.},

However, how the environment experienced during early life impacts later cognitive abilities remains poorly understood. Here, we used a cognitive task embedded in a video game to measure non-verbal spatial navigation ability in 442,195 people from 38 countries across the world. We found that on average, people who reported having grown up in cities have worse navigation skills than those who grew-up outside cities, even when controlling for age, gender, and level of education. The negative impact of cities was stronger in countries with low average Street Network Entropy, i.e. whose cities have a griddy layout. The effect was smaller in countries with more complex, organic cities. This evidences the impact of the environment on human cognition on a global scale, and highlights the importance of urban design on human cognition and brain function.},

While these city-level factors help to improve the quality of distance approximation functions for city-wide vehicle movements, more granular factors are needed to obtain accurate shortest path distance approximations for last-mile transportation systems that are typically characterized by local trips. More importantly, local circuity factors encode valuable information about the efficiency and complexity of the urban road network, which can be leveraged to inform policy and practice. In this paper, we quantify and analyze local network circuity leveraging contemporary traffic datasets. Using the city of São Paulo as our primary case study and a combination of supervised and un-supervised machine learning methods, we observe significant heterogeneities in local network circuity, explained by dimensional and topological properties of the road network. Locally, real trip distances are about twice as long as distances predicted by the L1 norm. Results from São Paulo are compared to seven additional urban areas in Latin America and the United States. At a coarse-grained level of analysis, we observe similar correlations between road network properties and local circuity across these cities.},

Yet the majority of road networks in Ghana and other countries in SubSahara Africa are not geographically referenced, to facilitate their uses for road maintenance and management, transport planning, emergency services, disaster cases, logistics, tourism and other location based services. Consequently, this study takes advantage of paratransit service and the location of landmarks to provide location addressing of road networks in Ghana. The paratransit service, popularly known as Trotro in Ghana is a local transit system that uses an automobile to move people and goods along a prescribed travel route on a road network, with locally known stops where people get on and oﬀ the vehicle. The Trotro service is popular in Ghana, yet there is no critical investigation demonstrating its spatial coverage, relevance as a credible location addressing for road networks, or as a comprehensive location data for location based services. This study provides evidence for this case, and investigates the spatial coverage of road networks used by the Trotro vehicles, and the mapping of their service stops together with landmarks in the Asokore Mampong Municipality (AMM) of Ashanti region in Ghana. It was found that the location data from both Trotro service and landmarks covered about 86\% of the entire road network in AMM; providing a large coverage of the road network and greater geographic detail. A service area estimation undertaken using the generated location data shows a high geographic accessibility, with travel distances as low as 160 m from any location to the nearest Trotro service or landmark covering about 80\% of the road networks. These results show the capability of the generated location data to tackle the problem of spatially unreferenced road networks, and to signiﬁcantly improve their eﬀective uses. The popularity of paratransit in Sub-Sahara Africa means that this study can be adapted to other countries where the majority of the road networks are not spatially referenced.},

	doi = {10.1101/2020.05.03.20089235},
	abstract = {Re-opening societies and economies across the globe following the initial wave of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic requires scientifically-guided decision processes and policy development. Public health authorities now consider it highly likely that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 will follow a pattern of seasonal circulation globally. To guide mitigation strategies and tactics in a location-specific manner, accurate simulation of prolonged or intermittent patterns of social/physical distancing is required in order to prevent healthcare systems and communities from collapsing. It is equally important to capture the stochastic appearance of individual transmission events. Traditional epidemiological/statistical models cannot make predictions in a geospatial temporal manner based on human individuals in a community. Thus, the challenge is to conduct spatio-temporal simulations of transmission chains with real-world geospatial and georeferenced information of the dynamics of the disease and the effect of different mitigation strategies such as isolation of infected individuals or location closures. Here, we present a stochastic, geospatially referenced and demography-specific agent-based model with agents representing human beings and include information on age, household composition, daily occupation and schedule, risk factors, and other relevant properties. Physical encounters between humans are modeled in a time-dependent georeferenced network of the population. The model (GERDA-1) can predict infection dynamics under normal conditions and test the effect of different mitigation scenarios such as school closures, reduced social contacts as well as closure or reopening of public/work spaces. Specifically, it also includes the fate and influence of health care workers and their access to protective gear. Key predictions so far entail: (i) the effect of specific groups on the spreading, specifically that children in school contribute substantially to distribution. (ii) the result of reopening society depends crucially on how strict the measures have been during lock-down. (iii) the outcome of reopening is a stochastic process - in the majority of cases, we must expect a second wave, in some cases not. To the best of our best knowledge, the GERDA-1 model is the first model able to predict a bimodal behavior of SARS-Cov-2 infection dynamics. Given the criticality of the global situation, informing the scientific community, decision makers and the general public seems prudent. Therefore, we here provide a pre-print of the GERDA-1 model together with a first set of predictions and analyses as work in progress.},

However, maintaining an accurate and up-to-date map is a highly challenging task that usually involves a substantial amount of manual work. To reduce the manual efforts, methods have been proposed to automatically derive road attributes by mining GPS traces. However, previous methods always modeled each road attribute separately based on intuitive hand-crafted features extracted from GPS traces. This observation motivates us to propose a machine learning based method to learn joint features not only from GPS traces but also from map data. To model the relations among the target road attributes, we extract low-level shared feature embeddings via multi-task learning, while still being able to generate task-specific fused representations by applying attention-based feature fusion. To model the relations between the target road attributes and other contextual information that is available from a digital map, we propose to leverage map tiles at road centers as visual features that capture the information of the surrounding geographic objects around the roads. We perform extensive experiments on the OpenStreetMap where state-of-the-art classification accuracy has been obtained compared to existing road attribute detection approaches.},

Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. Our findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.},

The ability of transport systems to maintain functionality despite various disturbances (i.e. robustness) is hence of tremendous importance and has been the focus of research seeking to support transport planning, design and management. These approaches and findings may nevertheless be only valid for the specific networks studied. The present study attempts to find universal insights into road networks robustness by exploring the correlation between different network attributes and network robustness to single, multiple, random and targeted link failures. For this purpose, the common properties of road graphs were identified through a literature review. On this basis, the GREREC model was developed to randomly generate a variety of abstract networks presenting the topological and operational characteristics of real-road networks, on which a robustness analysis was performed. This analysis quantifies the difference between the link criticality rankings when only single-link failures are considered as opposed to when multiple-link failures are considered and the difference between the impact of targeted and random attacks. The influence of the network attributes on the network robustness and on these two differences is shown and discussed. Finally, this analysis is also performed on a set of real road networks to validate the results obtained with the artificial networks.},

We report on global, national, and city-level trends since 1975 in the street-network disconnectedness index (SNDi), based on every mapped node and edge in the world. Streets in new developments in 90\% of the 134 most populous countries have become less connected since 1975, while just 29\% show an improving trend since 2000. The same period saw a near doubling in the relative frequency of a street-network type characterized by high circuity, typical of gated communities. We identify persistence in street-network sprawl, indicative of path-dependent processes. Specifically, cities and countries with low connectivity in recent years also had relatively low preexisting connectivity in our earliest time period. We discuss implications for policy intervention in road building in new and expanding cities as a top priority for sustainable urban development.},

The built landscape alone ranges from low-density, one-storey suburban settlements to high-density accumulations of skyscrapers. Models have repeatedly attempted to describe these various ‘city’ manifestations and to understand the processes that shape these spatial appearances and patterns. In this paper we analyze the morphological-spatial configurations of urban landscapes. We empirically examine 110 cities distributed around the globe. By using the Local Climate Zones (LCZs) classification scheme, we quantitatively describe morphologic variances of the built landscape within cities. We find seven city types (clusters) that capture the global diversity of spatial urban configurations. These seven types testify in parts to common geographic-cultural spaces. Some are largely congruent with wellknown spatial units such as Europe or the Islamic world. In contrast to theoretical city models, however, we also find clusters that are more spatially complex such as African-American or Asian-African clusters. On the one hand, the study confirms that similar cultural, socio-economic, demographic or political conditions in fact do produce similar morphologic-spatial urban configurations. On the other hand, it also shows that there exist similar morphological configurations across geographic-cultural spaces.},

The physical form of cities has significant implications for their capacity to deal with adverse events and changing conditions. This paper focuses on streets as major constituent elements of urban form. It offers a review of the theoretical discussions and empirical evidence on how design and configuration of urban streets and street networks can contribute to/detract from urban resilience. For the purpose of this study, measures related to urban streets are divided into two broad categories: network topology and design and orientation. Network topology is used to represent urban street network as a combination of nodes and links. Relationships between urban resilience and different centrality and connectivity measures related to network topology are discussed. The design and orientation category explores the possible effects of street width, street edges, street canyon geometry, and street layout and orientation on resilience of cities. It is discussed that all topology and design measures have implications for urban resilience. Appropriate physical form of urban streets can contribute to urban resilience by, among other things, ameliorating urban microclimate, reducing energy consumption and its associated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, enhancing social capital, improving community health and well-being, and facilitating rapid and effective emergency response in the aftermath of disasters. Overall, results provide insights about physical properties that are required to design resilient streets and street networks.},

	doi = {10.1186/1476-072X-11-14},
	abstract = {Background: Obesity researchers increasingly use geographic information systems to measure exposure and access in neighborhood food and physical activity environments. This paper proposes a network buffering approach, the “sausage” buffer. This method can be consistently and easily replicated across software versions and platforms, avoiding problems with proprietary systems that use different approaches in creating such buffers.
Methods: In this paper, we describe how the sausage buffering approach was developed to be repeatable across platforms and places. We also examine how the sausage buffer compares with existing alternatives in terms of buffer size and shape, measurements of the food and physical activity environments, and associations between environmental features and health-related behaviors. We test the proposed buffering approach using data from EAT 2010 (Eating and Activity in Teens), a study examining multi-level factors associated with eating, physical activity, and weight status in adolescents (n = 2,724) in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota.
Results: Results show that the sausage buffer is comparable in area to the classic ArcView 3.3 network buffer particularly for larger buffer sizes. It obtains similar results to other buffering techniques when measuring variables associated with the food and physical activity environments and when measuring the correlations between such variables and outcomes such as physical activity and food purchases.
Conclusions: Findings from various tests in the current study show that researchers can obtain results using sausage buffers that are similar to results they would obtain by using other buffering techniques. However, unlike proprietary buffering techniques, the sausage buffer approach can be replicated across software programs and versions, allowing more independence of research from specific software.},

Such a pattern reflects a trade-off between housing price/commuting cost and employment. However, most previous studies in urban population density functions are based on the Euclidean distance, and do not consider commuting cost in cities. This study provides an empirical evaluation of the classic population density functions in 382 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) in the USA using travel times to city centres as the independent variable. The major findings of the study are: (1) the negative exponential function has the overall best fit for population density in the MSAs; (2) the Gaussian and exponential functions tend to fit larger MSAs, while the power function has better performance for small MSAs; (3) most of the MSAs appear to show a decentralisation trend during 1990–2016, and larger MSAs tend to have a higher rate of decentralisation. This study leverages crowdsourced geospatial data to provide empirical evidence of the classic urban economic models. The findings will increase our understanding about urban morphology, population–job displacement and urban decentralisation. The findings also provide baseline information to monitor and predict the changing trend of urban population distribution that could be driven by future environmental and technological changes.},

This paper attempts to determine important transport and socio-economic indicators from 151 urban areas and 51 countries, based on comparable, directly observable open-source data such as OpenstreetMap (OSM) and the TomTom database. Analysis: This is the first, systematic indicator-analysis using recent, open source data from different urban areas around the world. The indicator road kilometers per person, sometimes cited as infrastructure accessibility is calculated by processing OSM data. Information on congestion levels have been taken from the TomTom database and socio-economic data from various, publicly accessible databases. Relations between indicators are identified through correlations and regression models are calibrated, quantifying the relation between transport infrastructure and performance indicators. Three sub-categories of cities with different population sizes (small cities, large cities and metropolises) are defined and studied individually. In addition, a qualitative analysis is performed, putting five different indicators into relation. Results \& Conclusions: The main results reconfirm previous findings but with a larger sample size and more comparable data. Good correlation values between infrastructure accessibility, socio-economic indicators, and congestion levels are demonstrated. It is shown that cities with higher GDP have generally built more infrastructure which in turn reduces their congestion levels. In particular, for cities with low population density (above approximately 1500 inh. Per sq.km), more roads per inhabitant lead to lower congestion levels; cities with high population density have in general lower congestion levels if the rail infrastructure per person ratio is high. Furthermore, these cities increasing railways per person is more effective in reducing congestions than increasing road length per person.},

	abstract = {The use of typomorphology as a means of understanding urban areas has a long tradition amongst academics but the reach of these methods into urban design practice has been limited. In this paper we present a method to support the description and prescription of urban form that is contextsensitive, multi-dimensional, systematic, exploratory, and quantitative, thus facilitating the application of urban typomorphology to planning practice. At the core of the proposed method is the k-means statistical clustering technique to produce objective classifications from the large complex data sets typical of urban environments. Block and street types were studied as a test case and a context-sensitive sample of types that correspond to two different neighbourhoods were identified. This method is suitable to support the identification, understanding and description of emerging urban forms that do not fall into standard classifications. The method can support larger urban form studies through consistent application of the procedures to different sites. The quantitative nature of its output lends itself to integration with other systematic procedures related to the research, analysis, planning and design of urban areas.},

	abstract = {The street-network efﬁciency of tens of British cities in relation to transport fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are analyzed. The results show a strong linear positive correlation between length entropy and average street length, and a negative correlation between entropy and street density. Also, the results suggest that in a large city the street network is used more efﬁciently than in a small city, as indicated by the sublinear relations between city size (population) and the number of streets, total length of streets, and the area covered by the street network. The sublinear relation means that these parameters grow more slowly than the city size. By contrast, because a larger fraction of the street network is used at close to full capacity during considerable part of the time in a large city than a small one, the fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions show a linear relation with city size and superlinear relation with total street length. The superlinear relation means that the CO2 emissions increase faster than the total street length, a measure of the network size. Thus, large cities may be less energy efﬁcient and environmentally friendly than small cities. In every city the street network needs to interconnect all the buildings, which requires a certain minimum size. In a small city, however, the network is used to a low capacity most of the time so that its relations to fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions are more favorable than those in a large city.},

In several ways, platforms may be understood as black boxes due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, the secrecy of corporate ownership structures, and the emphasis on conﬁdentiality and privacy in the venture capital industry. While thus raising concerns about scrutiny and accountability, inclinations to “open the black box” of platforms reﬂect a limited and limiting horizon of political possibility. In a diﬀerent vein, geographers concerned with the digitalurban interface are working to think about the potential for a counter-politics that is not rooted exclusively in resistance or antagonism. Drawing on these insights, this intervention complements recent work on digital methods by emphasizing tracing, counter-mapping, and proxying as approaches that do not privilege the revelation of visibility so much as potentiality, slipperiness, and movement.},

This article presents a framework for analyzing the relationship between short-term rentals and gentrification, an exploratory case study of New York City, and an agenda for future research. We argue that Airbnb has introduced a new potential revenue flow into housing markets which is systematic but geographically uneven, creating a new form of rent gap in culturally desirable and internationally recognizable neighborhoods. This rent gap can emerge quickly—in advance of any declining property income—and requires minimal new capital to be exploited by a range of different housing actors, from developers to landlords, tenants, and homeowners. Performing spatial analysis on three years of Airbnb activity in New York City, we measure new capital flows into the short-term rental market, identify neighborhoods whose housing markets have already been significantly impacted by short term, identify neighborhoods which are increasingly under threat of Airbnb-induced gentrification, and estimate the amount of rental housing lost to Airbnb. Finally, we conclude by offering a research agenda on gentrification and the sharing economy.},

	abstract = {The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called "surveillance capitalism," and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behavior. In this masterwork of original thinking and research, Shoshana Zuboff provides startling insights into the phenomenon that she has named surveillance capitalism. The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth. Zuboff vividly brings to life the consequences as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every economic sector. Vast wealth and power are accumulated in ominous new "behavioral futures markets," where predictions about our behavior are bought and sold, and the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new "means of behavioral modification." The threat has shifted from a totalitarian Big Brother state to a ubiquitous digital architecture: a "Big Other" operating in the interests of surveillance capital. Here is the crucible of an unprecedented form of power marked by extreme concentrations of knowledge and free from democratic oversight. Zuboff's comprehensive and moving analysis lays bare the threats to twenty-first century society: a controlled "hive" of total connection that seduces with promises of total certainty for maximum profit -- at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human future. With little resistance from law or society, surveillance capitalism is on the verge of dominating the social order and shaping the digital future -- if we let it.},

	abstract = {The spatial structure of cities, i.e. their composition, shape and degree of fragmentation or compactness, is a physical expression reflecting development efficiency. Identifying the evolution of urban systems in time and space is crucial towards sustainable urban development. In this paper, we assess the spatial structure of 194 cities from 1990 and 2015, in order to identify patterns, clusters of similar cities, trajectories, and the global distribution of urban form. We delineated the contiguous urban fabric, employed landscape metrics to quantitatively describe urban patterns, applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of data to an uncorrelated set of variables and identified groups of cities with similar urban forms by means of hierarchical clustering. We found four types of urban form: compact-grey, transitional, ragged-small and fragmented-complex cities. Globally, continentally and regionally, cities have followed a trend towards more homo­ geneous urban forms, most of them becoming transitional as a consequence of both, processes of fragmentation and compactness. The only exception of this trend is a group of large cities in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, which are still predominantly fragmented-complex. Under the persisting process of urban expansion, small to medium-sized cities showed to be the most dynamic in terms of expansion and change in urban form, which makes them key towards sustainable urban development. This analysis contributes to the understanding of the transformations induced by the process of urban expansion that shapes urban form. Such information is crucial for achieving urban sustainability.},

The accuracy of DEM elevation points from Google Earth was compared against that of DEMs from ASTER and SRTM for flat, hilly and mountainous sections of a pre-selected rural watershed. For each section, a total of 5,000 DEM elevation points were extracted as samples from each type of DEM data. The DEM data from Google Earth and SRTM for flat and hilly sections are strongly correlated with the R2 of 0.791 and 0.891 respectively. Even stronger correlation is shown for the mountainous section where the R2 values between Google Earth’s DEM and ASTER’s and between Google Earth’s DEM and SRTM’s DEMs are respectively 0.917 and 0.865. Further accuracy testing was carried out by utilising the DEM dataset to delineate Muar River’s watershed boundary using ArcSWAT2009, a hydrological modelling software. The result shows that the percentage differences of the watershed size delineated from Google Earth’s DEM compared to those derived from Department of Irrigation and Drainage’s data (using 20m-contour topographic map), ASTER and SRTM data are 9.6\%, 10.6\%, and 7.6\% respectively. It is therefore justified to conclude that the DEM derived from Google Earth is relatively as acceptable as DEMs from other sources.},

Spatial analysis is often used to explore relationships between proximity to sources of food and health outcomes such as food security and risk for diet-related disease. Spatial models often account for proximity based on walking distance or automobile but advancements in geospatial technologies now allow for estimates of access by transit as well as travel time to understand neighborhood level food security. One approach for addressing this gap is to employ real-time travel estimates over transit and road networks to more precisely measure food access. In this paper, we compare the Google Distance Matrix API calculating both the distance and time between origins and destinations, with other spatial approaches to understanding grocery store and fullservice supermarket access in this case study of San Diego, California. Results suggest that distances between residents and food outlets are constant across modes of transport but travel times are highly differentiated by mode. Trips to stores by transit are on average, three times longer than trips by car. This paper offers a new understanding of the potential for incongruence between spatial proximity and true accessibility in the built environment.},

	doi = {10.1186/1476-072X-13-43},
	abstract = {Background: The World Health Organization recommends strategies to improve urban design, public transportation, and recreation facilities to facilitate physical activity for non-communicable disease prevention for an increasingly urbanized global population. Most evidence supporting environmental associations with physical activity comes from single countries or regions with limited variation in urban form. This paper documents variation in comparable built environment features across countries from diverse regions.
Methods: The International Physical Activity and the Environment Network (IPEN) study of adults aimed to measure the full range of variation in the built environment using geographic information systems (GIS) across 12 countries on 5 continents. Investigators in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States followed a common research protocol to develop internationally comparable measures. Using detailed instructions, GIS-based measures included features such as walkability (i.e., residential density, street connectivity, mix of land uses), and access to public transit, parks, and private recreation facilities around each participant’s residential address using 1-km and 500-m street network buffers.
Results: Eleven of 12 countries and 15 cities had objective GIS data on built environment features. We observed a 38-fold difference in median residential densities, a 5-fold difference in median intersection densities and an 18-fold difference in median park densities. Hong Kong had the highest and North Shore, New Zealand had the lowest median walkability index values, representing a difference of 9 standard deviations in GIS-measured walkability.
Conclusions: Results show that comparable measures can be created across a range of cultural settings revealing profound global differences in urban form relevant to physical activity. These measures allow cities to be ranked more precisely than previously possible. The highly variable measures of urban form will be used to explain individuals’ physical activity, sedentary behaviors, body mass index, and other health outcomes on an international basis. Present measures provide the ability to estimate dose–response relationships from projected changes to the built environment that would otherwise be impossible.},

We find that events account for a significant share of OpenStreetMap data and that organizational practices have shifted over time towards local knowledge-b­ased events and well-­organized data imports. However, regions in the “Global South” remain dependent on remote mapping events, pointing to uneven geographies of representation. We also find that events are frequently followed by periods of increased activity, with the exact nature of effects depending on contextual elements such as previous events. These findings portray organized activities as a significant and unique component which requires consideration when using OpenStreetMap data and analyzing their quality.},

While it promises better policymaking insights, concerns exist around its epistemological scope and impacts on privacy, ethics, and social control. This chapter reflects on the history and trajectory of urban analytics as a scholarly and professional discipline. In particular, it considers the direction in which this field is going and whether it improves our collective and individual welfare. It first introduces early theories, models, and deductive methods from which the field originated before shifting toward induction. It then explores urban network analytics that enrich traditional representations of spatial interaction and structure. Next it discusses urban applications of spatiotemporal big data and machine learning. Finally, it argues that privacy and ethical concerns are too often ignored as ubiquitous monitoring and analytics can empower social repression. It concludes with a call for a more critical urban analytics that recognizes its epistemological limits, emphasizes human dignity, and learns from and supports marginalized communities.},

This chapter introduces computational notebooks in the geographical context. It begins by explaining the computational paradigm and philosophy that underlie notebooks. Next it unpacks their architecture to illustrate a notebook user’s typical workflow. Then it discusses the main benefits notebooks offer GIS researchers and practitioners, including better integration with modern software, more natural access to new forms of data, and better alignment with the principles and benefits of open science. In this context, it identifies notebooks as the “glue” that binds together a broader ecosystem of open source packages and transferable platforms for computational geography. The chapter concludes with a brief illustration of using notebooks for a set of basic GIS operations. Compared to traditional desktop GIS, notebooks can make spatial analysis more nimble, extensible, and reproducible and have thus evolved into an important component of the geospatial science toolkit.},

Developing and evaluating indicators measuring inequalities in pedestrian accessibility can help planners and policymakers benchmark and monitor the progress of city planning interventions. However, measuring and assessing indicators of urban design and transport features at high resolution worldwide to enable city comparisons is challenging due to limited availability of official, high quality, and comparable spatial data, as well as spatial analysis tools offering customizable frameworks for indicator construction and analysis. To address these challenges, this study develops an open source software framework to construct pedestrian accessibility indicators for cities using open and consistent data. It presents a generalized method to consistently measure pedestrian accessibility at high resolution and spatially aggregated scale, to allow for both within- and betweencity analyses. The open source and open data methods developed in this study can be extended to other cities worldwide to support local planning and policymaking. The software is made publicly available for reuse in an open repository.},

We study the eﬀects of regulation of these platforms on the housing market using a quasi-experimental research design. 18 out of 88 cities in Los Angeles County have severely restricted short-term rentals by adopting Home Sharing Ordinances. We apply a panel regression-discontinuity design around the cities’ borders. Ordinances reduced listings by 50\% and housing prices by 2\%. Additional diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences estimates show that ordinances reduced rents also by 2\%. These estimates imply large eﬀects of Airbnb on property values in areas attractive to tourists (e.g. an increase of 15\% within 2.5km of Hollywood’s Walk of Fame).},

	abstract = {This article identifies proxies which account for the impacts that the Airbnb platform is having on housing in Greater London. We identify these by analysing the relationships between possible Airbnb misuse and the attributes of housing in the same locations. We assume misuse when listings of entire properties within the Airbnb platform do not conform with local regulations and where hosts who offer such housing have multiple listings. In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2\% of all properties in London, and up to 7\% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100\% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8\% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of £90 price increase per year. Finally, we discuss how this type of analysis can help build instruments to inform policies associated with the platform economy in relation to increasing polarisation in the London housing market.},

Biological effects of PM, including immune response, cytotoxicity, and mutagenicity, are reported. Epidemiological studies that outline the systemic health effects of PM are presented. Conclusion: While the integrated, per capita, exposure of PM for a large fraction of the first-world may be less than 1 mg per day, links between several syndromes, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, loss of cognitive function, anxiety, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, stroke, and PM exposure have been suggested.

Of note, recent ﬁndings have demonstrated that PM2.5 may still pose a hazard to public health even at very low levels (far below national standards) of exposure. The proposed underlying mechanisms whereby PM2.5 causes adverse effects to public health include inducing intracellular oxidative stress, mutagenicity/genotoxicity and inﬂammatory responses.

	abstract = {Urban liveability is a global priority for creating healthy, sustainable cities. Measurement of policy-relevant spatial indicators of the built and natural environment supports city planning at all levels of government. Analysis of their spatial distribution within cities, and impacts on individuals and communities, is crucial to ensure planning decisions are eﬀective and equitable. This paper outlines challenges and lessons from a 5-year collaborative research program, scaling up a software workﬂow for calculating a composite indicator of urban liveability for residential address points across Melbourne, to Australia’s 21 largest cities, and further extension to 25 global cities in diverse contexts.},

	abstract = {The “choice” in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program signals the mobility offered to voucher holders. However, some landlords use source of income (SOI) discrimination to exclude voucher holders—limiting their locational choices. We propose several factors likely to inﬂuence this landlord strategy including, market competitiveness, stereotypes, and racial discrimination. We examine the prevalence of express SOI discrimination and the effectiveness of SOI antidiscrimination laws. We utilize a novel dataset of 1,107,110 rental listings from the Craigslist pages of 77 mid-sized US cities. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant amounts of express SOI discrimination, even where there are SOI antidiscrimination laws. Using multilevel models, we ﬁnd that landlords are more likely to expressly discriminate in lower-opportunity neighborhoods and when they own market-competitive units. We also ﬁnd that these factors are moderated by the concentration of voucher holders. These ﬁndings underscore how landlord strategies can combine to undermine the choice afforded to voucher holders.},

	abstract = {Increasing Spanish ﬂuency in the United States likely shapes ethnoracial group boundaries and inequality. We study a key site for group boundary negotiations—the housing market—where Spanish usage may represent a key source of information exchange between landlords and prospective renters. Speciﬁcally, we examine the use of Spanish in advertisements for online rental housing and its effect on White, Black, and Latinx Americans’ residential preferences. Using a corpus of millions of Craigslist rental listings, we show that Spanish listings are concentrated in majority-Latinx neighborhoods with greater proportions of immigrant and Spanish-speaking residents. Furthermore, units that are advertised in Spanish tend be lower priced relative to non-Spanish ads in the same neighborhood. We then use a survey experiment to demonstrate that Spanish usage decreases White, Black, and non-Spanish-speaking Latinx Americans’ interest in a housing unit and surrounding neighborhood, whereas Spanish-speaking Latinx respondents are less affected. We discuss these ﬁndings in light of past work on neighborhood demographic preferences, segregation, and recent theorizing on within-category inequality.},
