  abstract =      {Urban sprawl has been related to numerous negative
                   environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Meanwhile,
                   urban areas have been growing at alarming rates,
                   urging for assessing sprawl towards sustainable
                   development. However, sprawl is an elusive term and
                   different approaches to measure it have lead to
                   heterogeneous results. Moreover, most studies rely on
                   private/commercial data-sets and their software is
                   rarely made public, impeding research reproducibility
                   and comparability. Furthermore, many works give as
                   result a unique value for a region of analysis,
                   dismissing local spatial diversity that is vital for
                   urban planners and policy makers. We present in this
                   paper an open source framework for assessing urban
                   sprawl using open data. Locations of residential and
                   activity units are used to measure mixed use
                   development and built-up dispersion, whereas the
                   street network is used to measure accessibility
                   between different land uses. Sprawl patterns are
                   identiﬁed, and the resulting spatial information
                   allows focusing on particular neighborhoods for a
                   ﬁne-grained analysis, as well as visualizing each
                   sprawl dimension separately.},

  abstract =      {Cities are complex, perhaps one of the most complex
                   kinds of structure created by humans. Some cities
                   have been planned to a large extent while others have
                   grown organically. The outcome of planning and growth
                   processes is the diverse morphological built form and
                   street patterns observed in cities today. So far, in
                   urban planning and history research, cities are
                   classiﬁed as planned or organic, largely based on
                   the visual assessment of their urban morphology. To
                   understand cities and their characteristics, it is
                   necessary to develop methods that quantitatively
                   describe these characteristics and enable objective
                   comparisons between cities. Using graph
                   representations of the street network of cities, it
                   is possible to calculate measures that seem to
                   exhibit patterns with scale-free properties (Jiang in
                   Phys A Stat Mech Appl 384(2):647–655, 2007). And
                   thanks to progress in the ﬁeld of complexity
                   studies, it is also possible to test if and to what
                   extent the distribution of a measure in a collection
                   of elements ﬁts a power law distribution (Clauset
                   et al. in SIAM Rev 51:43, 2009). In this chapter, we
                   show that the degree distribution of a city’s
                   street network seems to ﬁt a power law distribution
                   for cities that are considered to have mostly grown
                   organically. On the other hand, cities that are
                   planned to a large extent do not exhibit such a good
                   ﬁt. This result is relevant since a power law
                   distribution is a signature of multiplicative growth
                   processes. Furthermore, the result of the
                   quantitative classiﬁcation method correlates well
                   with the results of earlier qualitative morphological
                   classiﬁcations of cities.},

                   travel across different cities. While these
                   city-level factors help to improve the quality of
                   distance approximation functions for city-wide
                   vehicle movements, more granular factors are needed
                   to obtain accurate shortest path distance
                   approximations for last-mile transportation systems
                   that are typically characterized by local trips. More
                   importantly, local circuity factors encode valuable
                   information about the efficiency and complexity of
                   the urban road network, which can be leveraged to
                   inform policy and practice. In this paper, we
                   quantify and analyze local network circuity
                   leveraging contemporary traffic datasets. Using the
                   city of São Paulo as our primary case study and a
                   combination of supervised and un-supervised machine
                   learning methods, we observe significant
                   heterogeneities in local network circuity, explained
                   by dimensional and topological properties of the road
                   network. Locally, real trip distances are about twice
                   as long as distances predicted by the L1 norm.
                   Results from São Paulo are compared to seven
                   additional urban areas in Latin America and the
                   United States. At a coarse-grained level of analysis,
                   we observe similar correlations between road network
                   properties and local circuity across these cities.},

  abstract =      {The quality of a digital map is of utmost importance
                   for geo-aware services. However, maintaining an
                   accurate and up-to-date map is a highly challenging
                   task that usually involves a substantial amount of
                   manual work. To reduce the manual efforts, methods
                   have been proposed to automatically derive road
                   attributes by mining GPS traces. However, previous
                   methods always modeled each road attribute separately
                   based on intuitive hand-crafted features extracted
                   from GPS traces. This observation motivates us to
                   propose a machine learning based method to learn
                   joint features not only from GPS traces but also from
                   map data. To model the relations among the target
                   road attributes, we extract low-level shared feature
                   embeddings via multi-task learning, while still being
                   able to generate task-specific fused representations
                   by applying attention-based feature fusion. To model
                   the relations between the target road attributes and
                   other contextual information that is available from a
                   digital map, we propose to leverage map tiles at road
                   centers as visual features that capture the
                   information of the surrounding geographic objects
                   around the roads. We perform extensive experiments on
                   the OpenStreetMap where state-of-the-art
                   classification accuracy has been obtained compared to
                   existing road attribute detection approaches.},

                   neural planner is used to generate many possible
                   paths. Training of the neural planner is a onetime
                   task using a physics-based model to create the
                   training data. The outputs of the neural planner are
                   achievable paths. The path intersections are
                   represented as decision waypoint nodes in a graph.
                   The graph is interpreted as a Markov Decision Process
                   (MDP). The resulting MDP is much faster than

                   reinforcement algorithms because only high-level

                   fairly isolated from these currents and a number of
                   possible explanations for that isolation are

                   the charge in engaging with these opportunities are

  abstract =      {Over the last fifty years, research into street
                   networks has gained prominence with a rapidly growing
                   number of studies across disparate disciplines. These
                   studies investigate a wide range of phenomena using a
                   wealth of data and diverse analytical techniques.
                   Starting within the fields of transport or
                   infrastructure engineering, street networks have
                   commonly been treated as sets of more or less
                   homogeneous linear elements, connecting locations and
                   intersecting at junctions. This view is commonly
                   represented as a graph, which provides a common and
                   rigorous formalisation accessible across disciplines
                   and is particularly well-suited for problems such as
                   flow optimisation and routing. Street networks are,
                   however, complex objects of investigation and the way
                   we model and then represent them as graphs has
                   fundamental effects on the outcomes of a study. Many
                   approaches to modelling street networks have been
                   proposed, each lending itself to different analyses
                   and supporting insights into diverse aspects of the
                   urban system. Yet, this plurality and the relation
                   between different models remains relatively obscure
                   and unexplored. The motivations for adopting a given
                   model of the network are also not always clear and
                   often seem to follow disciplinary traditions. This
                   paper provides an overview of key street network
                   models and the prima facie merits of pertinent
                   alternative approaches. It suggests greater attention
                   to consistent use of terms and concepts, of graph
                   representations and practical applications, and
                   concludes with suggestions for possible ways
                   forward.},

  abstract =      {We quantify the importance of early action to tackle
                   urban sprawl. We focus on the long-term nature of
                   infrastructure decisions, speciﬁcally local
                   roadways, which can lock in greenhouse gas emissions
                   for decades to come. The location and
                   interconnectedness of local roadways form a
                   nearpermanent backbone for the future layout of land
                   parcels, buildings, and transportation options. We
                   provide new estimates of the environmental impact of
                   low-connectivity roads, characterized by cul-de-sacs
                   and T-intersections, which we dub street-network
                   sprawl. We ﬁnd an elasticity of vehicle ownership
                   with respect to street connectivity of
                   –0.15—larger than suggested by previous research.
                   We then apply this estimate to quantify the long-term
                   emissions implications of alternative scenarios for
                   street-network sprawl. On current trends alone, we
                   project vehicle travel and emissions to fall by
                   ∼3.2\% over the 2015–2050 period, compared to a
                   scenario where sprawl plateaus at its 1994 peak.
                   Concerted policy efforts to increase street
                   connectivity could more than triple these reductions
                   to ∼8.8\% by 2050. Longer-term reductions over the
                   2050–2100 period are more speculative, but could be
                   more than 50\% greater than those achieved by 2050.
                   The longer the timescale over which mitigation
                   efforts are considered, the more important it becomes
                   to address the physical form of the built
                   environment.},

                   sprawl—that is, sprawl as measured through the
                   local connectivity of the street network. Using
                   high-resolution data from OpenStreetMap and a
                   satellite-derived time series of urbanization, we
                   compute and validate changes over time in
                   multidimensional street connectivity measures based
                   on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts. We report
                   on global, national, and city-level trends since 1975
                   in the street-network disconnectedness index (SNDi),
                   based on every mapped node and edge in the world.
                   Streets in new developments in 90\% of the 134 most
                   populous countries have become less connected since
                   1975, while just 29\% show an improving trend since
                   2000. The same period saw a near doubling in the
                   relative frequency of a street-network type
                   characterized by high circuity, typical of gated
                   communities. We identify persistence in
                   street-network sprawl, indicative of path-dependent
                   processes. Specifically, cities and countries with
                   low connectivity in recent years also had relatively
                   low preexisting connectivity in our earliest time
                   period. We discuss implications for policy
                   intervention in road building in new and expanding
                   cities as a top priority for sustainable urban
                   development.},

                   in the communities of GIScience, transportation, and
                   urban planning. Meanwhile, road network structure has
                   been analyzed from a network science perspective that
                   focuses on nodes and relational links and aims to
                   predictive models. However, limited empirical studies
                   have explored the relationship between road network
                   structure and ride-sharing accessibility through such
                   perspective. This paper utilizes the spatial Durbin
                   model to understand the relationship between road
                   network structure and ridesharing accessibility,
                   proxied by Uber accessibility, through classical
                   network measures of degree, closeness, and
                   betweenness centrality. Taking the city of Atlanta as
                   a case study, we have found in addition to population
                   density and road network density, larger values of
                   degree centrality and smaller values of closeness
                   centrality of the road network are associated with
                   better accessibility of Uber services. However, the
                   eﬀects of betweenness centrality are not
                   signiﬁcant. Furthermore, we have revealed
                   heterogeneous eﬀects of degree centrality and
                   closeness centrality on the accessibility of Uber
                   services, as the magnitudes of their eﬀects vary by
                   diﬀerent time windows (i.e., weekday vs. weekend,
                   rush hour in the morning vs. evening). Network
                   science provides us both conceptual and
                   methodological measures to understand the association
                   between road network structure and ride-sharing
                   accessibility. In this study, we constructed road
                   network structure measures with OpenStreetMap, which
                   is reproducible, replicable, and scalable because of
                   its global coverage and public availability. The
                   study resonates with the notion of cities as the set
                   of interactions across networks, as we have observed
                   time-sensitive heterogeneous eﬀects of road network
                   structure on ride-sharing accessibility.},

                   the human experience cannot be overstated. All of our
                   daily activities fall along, or in close proximity
                   to, roads, bike paths, and subway systems to name a
                   few. Therefore, when performing spatial analysis in
                   many cases considering network space, as opposed to
                   Euclidean space, allows for a more precise
                   representation of daily human action and movement
                   patterns. For example, people generally cannot get to
                   work by driving in a straight line directly from
                   their home, but move along paths within networks. To

  abstract =      {Urban morphology is the area of urban studies that
                   explores the physical form of cities in space and the
                   way it changes in time in relation to the agents of
                   such change (Kropf, 2017). The discipline is based on
                   the analysis of space, traditionally mostly visual
                   and qualitative (Dibble et al., 2015); its objects
                   are the fundamental elements of urban form (building,
                   plot, street) (Moudon, 1997) as well as a range of
                   analytical constructs such as axial maps
                   (Ariza-Villaverde, Jiménez-Hornero, \& Ravé, 2013)
                   or proximity bands (Araldi \& Fusco, 2019). The
                   increased availability of morphological data and
                   computational power have led in time to more emphasis
                   on quantitative forms of analysis, and the emergence
                   of Urban Morphometrics (UMM) (Dibble et al., 2017):
                   this approach describes urban form via the systematic
                   and comprehensive measurement of its morphological
                   characters. Since UMM analysis is addressed both
                   in-depth and at large scale, it is grounded on the
                   intensive use of GIS software (proprietary ArcGIS,
                   MapInfo, open-source QGIS) either through built-in
                   processing tools or specific plugins like Urban
                   Network Analysis (Sevtsuk \& Mekonnen, 2012) or Place
                   Syntax Tool (Ståhle, Marcus, \& Karlström, 2005).
                   However, essential functions to conduct such
                   measurements on specific urban morphometric
                   characters or processes such as morphological
                   tessellation, are not always available: current
                   plugins offer only a limited number of
                   functionalities as they are mainly application or
                   case-specific. This paper is hereby proposing momepy,
                   a Python toolkit which aims to overcome such
                   limitations by enabling a systematic in-depth
                   analysis of urban form, to comprehensively include a
                   wide range of measurable characters, with a prospect
                   of expanding future development due to its
                   open-source nature and independence on proprietary
                   software or operating systems. The development of
                   momepy is timely, as the role of measurable
                   characters is vital to recognize form-based patterns
                   and establish descriptive and analytical frameworks
                   of human settlements, in the “age of

                   bearing and aggregate ﬂow; and ‘travel
                   watershed’ analysis. This paper demonstrates this
                   functionality using reproducible examples on real
                   transport datasets. More broadly, the experience of
                   developing and using R functions for transport
                   applications shows that open source software can form
                   the basis of a reproducible transport planning
                   workﬂow. The stplanr package, alongside other
                   packages and open source projects, could provide a
                   more transparent and democratically accountable
                   alternative to the current approach, which is heavily
                   reliant on proprietary and relatively inaccessible
                   software.},

  abstract =      {OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the most popular
                   examples of a Volunteered Geographic Information
                   (VGI) project. In the past years it has become a
                   serious alternative source for geodata. Since the
                   quality of OSM data can vary strongly, different
                   aspects have been investigated in several scientific
                   studies. In most cases the data is compared with
                   commercial or administrative datasets which, however,
                   are not always accessible due to the lack of
                   availability, contradictory licensing restrictions or
                   high procurement costs. In this investigation a
                   framework containing more than 25 methods and
                   indicators is presented, allowing OSM quality
                   assessments based solely on the data's history.
                   Without the usage of a reference data set,
                   approximate statements on OSM data quality are
                   possible. For this purpose existing methods are taken
                   up, developed further, and integrated into an
                   extensible open source framework. This enables
                   arbitrarily repeatable intrinsic OSM quality analyses
                   for any part of the world.},
